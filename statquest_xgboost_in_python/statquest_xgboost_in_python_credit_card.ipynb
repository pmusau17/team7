This is because, while **scikit learn Support Vector Machines** natively support continuous data, like **LIMIT_BAL** and **AGE**, they do not natively support categorical data, like **MARRIAGE**, which contains **3** different categories. Thus, in order to use categorical data with **scikit learn Support Vector Machines**, we have to use a trick that converts a column of categorical data into multiple columns of binary values. This trick is called **One-Hot Encoding**.\n",

That means the support vector machine would be more likely to cluster the people with 3s and 2s together than the people with 3s and 1s together. In contrast, if we treat these numbers like categorical data, then we treat each one as a separate category that is no more or less similar to any of the other categories. Thus, the likelihood of clustering people with 3s with 2s is the same as clustering 3s with 1s, and that approach is more reasonable."

    "**NOTE:** There are many different ways to do **One-Hot Encoding** in Python. Two of the more popular methods are `ColumnTransformer()` (from **scikit-learn**) and `get_dummies()` (from **pandas**), and both methods have pros and cons. `ColumnTransformer()` has a very cool feature where it creates a persistent function that can validate data that you get in the future. For example, if you build your **Support Vector Machine** using a categorical variable **favorite color** that has **red**, **blue** and **green** options, then `ColumnTransformer()` can remember those options and later on when your **Support Vector Machine** is being used in a production system, if someone says their favorite color is **orange**, then `ColumnTransformer()` can throw an error or handle the situation in some other nice way. The downside of `ColumnTransformer()` is that it turns your data into an array and loses all of the column names, making it harder to verify that your usage of `ColumnTransformer()` worked as you intended it to. In contrast, `get_dummies()` leaves your data in a dataframe and retains the column names, making it much easier to verify that it worked as intended. However, it does not have the persistent behavior that `ColumnTransformer()` has. So, for the sake of learning how **One-Hot Encoding** works, I prefer to use `get_dummies()`. However, once you are comfortable with **One-Hot Encoding**, I encourage you to investigate using `ColumnTransformer()`.\n",
