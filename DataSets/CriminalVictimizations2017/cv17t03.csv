"Note: Details may not sum to totals due to rounding. Classifications include threatened, attempted, and completed crimes. Total number of households was 131,962,260 in 2015, 133,365,270 in 2016, and 123,085,790 in 2017. The NCVS household weighting adjustment was updated for 2017, which decreased the estimated number of households, and the number of households experiencing property crime, by about 8%. As a result, readers should not compare the number of property crimes between 2016 and 2017. Property crime rates are unaffected by this change. See appendix table 5 for standard errors. See Methodology for details on the change in the household weighting adjustment in the NCVS.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
