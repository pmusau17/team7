"Note: Detail may not sum to total because a person may experience multiple types of crime. This prevalence measure is based on persons who experienced a violent victimization or whose households experienced a burglary or motor vehicle theft. Violent victimization includes rape or sexual assault, robbery, aggravated assault, and simple assault. This measure attributes a household's burglary to each person age 12 or older in the household. Motor vehicle thefts were attributed to persons only when they were the reference person for their household or were age 12 or older and related to the reference person. Classifications include threatened, attempted, and completed crimes. See appendix table 15 for standard errors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
