"Note: Details may not sum to totals because a person or household may experience multiple types of crime. Violent crime classifications include rape or sexual assault, robbery, aggravated assault, and simple assault, and they include threatened, attempted, and completed crimes. Other violent crime categories in this table, including domestic violence and violent crime involving injury, are not mutually exclusive from these classifications. There were 269,526,470 persons age 12 or older living in non-institutionalized residential settings in the United States in 2015, 272,204,190 in 2016, and 272,468,480 in 2017. Total number of households was 131,962,260 in 2015, 133,365,270 in 2016, and 123,085,790 in 2017. The NCVS household weighting adjustment was updated for 2017, which decreased the estimated number of households experiencing property crime by about 8%. As a result, readers should not compare the number of property crimes between 2016 and 2017. Property crime rates are unaffected by this change. See appendix table 13 for standard errors. See Methodology for details on the change in the household weighting adjustment in the NCVS.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
