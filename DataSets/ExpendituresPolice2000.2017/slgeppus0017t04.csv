"Note: City list and order are based on 2017 population, excluding Louisville, KY. (See table 2). Comparisons across cities should be made with caution as different local government arrangements affect cities’ responsibilities for police protection and other government functions. Police-protection expenditures are funds spent on regular police services, police patrols and communications, crime-prevention activities, temporary lockups and holding tanks, traffic safety and engineering (but not highway planning and engineering), vehicular inspection and licensing, buildings used exclusively for police purposes, maintenance of buildings used for police purposes, medical examiners and coroners, law enforcement activities of sheriffs’ offices, and, if employed by a police agency, unsworn school-crossing guards, parking meter-readers, and animal wardens.",,,,,,,
