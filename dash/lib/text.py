p1 = """2020 was a pivotal year around the world and within the context of the conversation around racial equity, justice, and equality. 
        Specifically, in the United States, thousands of protestors and activists have taken to the streets to call for police reform 
        and support for policies that effectively address the underlying factors that contribute to crime, poverty, and homelessness. 
        One of the most poignant demands of these individuals has been a call for a complete reimagining of law enforcement in the United States. 
        This project centers on one facet of this demand which is the reallocation of police budgets or more broadly “defunding the police.” 
        What does this call entail and is there merit to considering its implementation?"""

p2 = """Specifically, our goal is to discover if a reallocation of city budgets will result in an improved quality of life for city residents. 
However before proceeding, what do we mean by an “improved quality of life?”"""

p3 = """Discussions of defunding the police can benefit from more knowledge of how municipal budgets are alloacted in order to get an idea of how 
best to utilize tax-payer money. One natural question that arises is what is the impact of various spending choices on rates of crime? That has been
the guiding for this project. However it is worth noting that conversations about this topic must go further than this cursory analysis as focusing only on rates of crime
risks perpetuting biases endemic of the criminal justice system. With that in that mind Let's dive in. """

We began by exploring crime rates within 118 cities around the United States and analyzed how much is spent on policing per capita and how much is spent on other social services. We also analyzed other city metrics including income per capita, employment rate, populations below poverty level and education levels. Our goal was to discover what are the most significant factors in reducing crime rate. Here's a brief survey of crime rates within the cities we analyzed. Specifically the types of crime that we were most concerned with were property crime and violent crime. The cities were grouped into six distinct groups that were identifed using clustering. This allowed us to group cities with similar behavior into distinct segments. Feel free to explore the data by changing items in the sidebar.

In order to standardize the comparisons between different cities we utilized the well-known FiSC dataset produced by the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy. 
The FiSC dataset makes it possible to compare local government finances for 150 of the largest U.S. cities across more than 125 categories of revenues, expenditures, debt, and assets, with annual data going back to 1977.
An initial analysis for over 100 cities during 2010 - 2017 found that police budget did not have a direct impact rates of crime. On a national level we saw that the median police spending per capita and the median crime rate appear to behave 
in a synchronous fashion. Largely the trend seems reactive.

Spending on Housing and Community Development however had the highest impact on reducing rates of crime, as measured by the strength of correlations present in the data. 
While this correlation does not imply a causal relationship we infer that citizens fair better when there are contributions to adequate housing by municipal governments.

   The relationship between race and crime has been a widely debated and controversial topic for more than a century. Crime rates vary among racial groups, and explaining this phenomenon is a non-trivial task. In this regard, we chose to defer explanations to Academic research. However, it is worth noting that the over-representation of some racial minorities can in part be explained by socioeconomic status. These factors include poverty, exposure to poor neighborhoods, poor access to public education, housing segregation and these trends are present within our datasets. The variance in rates of crime is also present within the data. Below we display racial demographics alongside socioeconomic factors in order to facilitate a conversation about how to improve the quality of life of marginalized communities. Explore the trends within each group using the sidebar. 
"""

p8 = """ One pressing question is how does crime in the U.S differ by demographic characteristics? To answer this question we used the American Community Survey (ACS) provided by the Census Bureau for the years 2010-2017. This dataset contains a wealth of information. Notably, population, racial demographics, poverty estimates, and housing unit estimates. The results of our analysis showed that factors related to poverty were positively correlated with crime, while education labor force participation, and personal income were the strongest negative correlations. These results present a narrative consistent with those reported by the IMF, the World Bank and Amnesty International. 
"""

p9 = """Our data suggests that higher spending on policing does not, on its own merit, result in lower crime rates. In fact, our data indicates that the cities with the highest police
spending actually have higher violent crime rates. This does not mean policing causes crime, but does suggest its role in preventing crime is limited. Our analysis suggests 
that policing is not a proactive measure that improves the lives of residents, but instead is a reactive measure, with cities increasing police budgets to address crime when 
that may not be the most effective option.

The analysis performed for this report indicates that efforts to reduce poverty, provide social service support to residents, and increase educational attainment of citizens
would be more impactful than simply increasing police budgets. While our analysis did not provide strong enough evidence to develop a causal model, it does indicate that the 
aforementioned variables correlate more strongly, and in the case of poverty rates much more strongly, than police spending.
