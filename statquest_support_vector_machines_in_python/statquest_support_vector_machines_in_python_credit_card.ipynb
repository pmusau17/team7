    "1. We can remove the rows that contain missing data from the dataset. This is relatively easy to do, but it wastes all of the other values that we collected. How a big of a waste this is depends on how important this missing value is for classification. For example, if we are missing a value for **age**, and **age** is not useful for classifying if people have heart disease or not, then it would be a shame to throw out all of someone's data just because we do not have their **age**.\n",
    "2. We can **impute** the values that are missing. In this context **impute** is just a fancy way of saying \"we can make an educated guess about about what the value should be\". Continuing our example where we are missing a value for **age**, instead of throwing out the entire row of data, we can fill the missing value with the average age or the median age, or use some other, more sophisticated approach, to guess at an appropriate value.\n",

This is because, while **scikit learn Support Vector Machines** natively support continuous data, like **LIMIT_BAL** and **AGE**, they do not natively support categorical data, like **MARRIAGE**, which contains **3** different categories.

This trick is called **One-Hot Encoding**.\n",

That means the support vector machine would be more likely to cluster the people with 3s and 2s together than the people with 3s and 1s together. In contrast, if we treat these numbers like categorical data, then we treat each one as a separate category that is no more or less similar to any of the other categories. Thus, the likelihood of clustering people with 3s with 2s is the same as clustering 3s with 1s, and that approach is more reasonable."

    "**NOTE:** There are many different ways to do **One-Hot Encoding** in Python. Two of the more popular methods are `ColumnTransformer()` (from **scikit-learn**) and `get_dummies()` (from **pandas**), and the both methods have pros and cons. `ColumnTransformer()` has a very cool feature where it creates a persistent function that can validate data that you get in the future. For example, if you build your **Support Vector Machine** using a categorical variable **favorite color** that has **red**, **blue** and **green** options, then `ColumnTransformer()` can remember those options and later on when your **Support Vector Machine** is being used in a production system, if someone says their favorite color is **orange**, then `ColumnTransformer()` can throw an error or handle the situation in some other nice way. The downside of `ColumnTransformer()` is that it turns your data into an array and looses all of the column names, making it harder to verify that your usage of `ColumnTransformer()` worked as you intended it to. In contrast, `get_dummies()` leaves your data in a dataframe and retains the column names, making it much easier to verify that it worked as intended. However, it does not have the persistent behavior that `ColumnTransformer()` has. So, for the sake of learning how **One-Hot Encoding** works, I prefer to use `get_dummies()`. However, once you are comfortable with **One-Hot Encoding**, I encourage you to investigate using `ColumnTransformer()`.\n",

Lastly, because the skree plot showed that PC2 was not very different from PC3 or PC4, this is not a very good approximation."
