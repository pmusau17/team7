Floyd was later pronounced dead at a local hospital. The incident sparked protests across the country against police violence and in support of the Black Lives Matter movement.</p><p>The Post <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/dhs-compiled-intelligence-reports-on-journalists-who-published-leaked-documents/2020/07/30/5be5ec9e-d25b-11ea-9038-af089b63ac21_story.html#click=https://t.co/UEJyzCoJS7"">reported</a> that over the last week of July, the department’s Office of Intelligence and Analysis disseminated three reports that included information on New York Times reporter Mike Baker and Editor-in-Chief of the blog Lawfare, Benjamin Wittes, alleging that the journalists had published leaked, unclassified documents about DHS operations in Portland.</p><p>The reports included summaries of tweets written by Baker and Wittes, screenshots of the posts and information about the amount of engagement the posts received on the social media platform.</p><p>Neither Baker nor Wittes responded to the Tracker’s emailed requests for comment.</p><p>Following the Post’s article about the reports, Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf ordered the office to cease all collection of information on journalists and announced an investigation into the reports.

The Acting Secretary is committed to ensuring that all DHS personnel uphold the principles of professionalism, impartiality and respect for civil rights and civil liberties, particularly as it relates to the exercise of First Amendment rights.”</p><p>The production of these reports is consistent with the department’s <a href=""https://freedom.press/news/dhs-agents-are-suspected-attacking-or-injuring-least-30-journalists-portland/"">aggressive tactics</a> in Portland, sources told The Post, but such investigations are not intended to detail information about American citizens who have no connection to terrorist activity.

What are you guys doing?’” Swanson said. Her photographer explained they were preparing for a live shot and that they were reporting on the bar.

When they went to see what had gone wrong, the technician began rolling in the cable that connects the camera and the truck but only half of it came back.</p><p>“The tech stopped and looked down and said, ‘Oh my god, someone cut the cable,’” Swanson said.</p></div></div>

Both orders were subsequently vacated.</p><p>The book — “Too Much and Never Enough: How My Family Created the World’s Most Dangerous Man” and scheduled for release in July — details Mary L. Trump’s relationships with the president, family members and her father, Fred Trump Jr.</p><p>Judge Hal B. Greenwald granted the <a href=""https://www.politico.com/f/?id=00000173-0647-d83b-a5ff-0fd7235c0000"">temporary restraining order</a> at the request of President Trump’s younger brother Robert, who alleged that the book violates a non-disclosure agreement signed by members of the family as part of the settlement of Fred Trump Sr.’s estate following his death in 1999.</p><p>According to court filings, the agreement included a pledge not to indirectly or directly publish any memoir. Robert Trump asserted that her book may “contain material that could harm him” or members of the family “by divulging private or disparaging information about their relationship to the public.”</p><p>Attorneys for Mary Trump and Simon &amp; Schuster filed appeals the same day, arguing that the order constituted a prior restraint on core political speech in violation of the First Amendment, Politico <a href=""https://www.politico.com/news/2020/06/30/judge-blocks-release-of-book-by-trumps-niece-345577"">reported</a>.

Pogue is also the owner of the Texas Center for Documentary Photography and was a combat medic in the Vietnam War.</p><p>Pogue told the Tracker that had already passed through security into the BOK Center when he heard somebody yell that something was happening with the police outside.</p><p>“So I grabbed my camera bag and ran out front, but by the time I got there the three people had already been arrested and were being led across some grass to a police van,” Pogue said. “I followed the police and the three people and took some photographs.”</p><p>After the individuals were in the van, however, Pogue said the officers from the Tulsa Police turned to him “almost in unison” and asked who he was.</p><p>Pogue’s arrest report, which was released to the Tracker, states that Pogue followed police into a restricted area of the Trump rally and refused to leave, stating that he was media. The report also states that Pogue was allegedly “unable to provide proof of being with the media.”</p><p>Pogue told the Tracker that the police narrative is completely inaccurate.</p><p>“One police officer told me to stand back just a little bit more,” Pogue said. “So, I took a couple of giant steps backward and he was satisfied, so I just kept taking pictures. No one else said anything to me. There was nothing to indicate that I shouldn’t be there and nobody told me I couldn’t be.”</p><p>Pogue said that when the officers turned to him and asked who he was, he identified himself as a photojournalist, showed them the wristband he received after passing through the rally’s security screening and handed them his business card.</p><p>“It was really generational: One of the younger police officers said, ‘Well, you’ve got your wristband, you’re obviously a photojournalist. I guess you can go now,’” Pogue said. “Then an older officer said, ‘No, no, no, you can’t go now.’”</p><p>Officers searched through his camera bag, which contained not only his equipment but a medical kit and a bulletproof vest that he had worn through security. Pogue told the Tracker that, during the search, one of the officers said, “It looks like he’s some kind of social justice advocate.”</p><p>When Pogue located his digital copy of a letter from the Observer verifying that he was on assignment for the news organization, he showed it to the older officer.</p><p>“[The officer] then grabs my iPhone and is flipping through my emails, and I said, ‘Officer, you do not have my permission to look through my iPhone,” Pogue said. “But, he saw that I’m also a member of the Veterans for Peace, and that pretty much nailed me.”</p><p>Pogue said that he was placed under arrest, but that the officers were not rough with him and didn’t zip-tie his hands too tightly.</p><p>A spokesperson from the Tulsa County jail told the Tracker that Pogue was arrested at approximately 5:40 p.m., and booked in the jail at 7:17 p.m. He was released on a $500 bond paid by the Tulsa Bail Project at around 11:20 p.m.</p><p>The Tulsa Police Department, the arresting agency, did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Pogue was charged with obstructing or interfering with an officer, the spokesperson said, which is a misdemeanor <a href=""https://law.justia.com/codes/oklahoma/2006/os21.html"">punishable</a> by up to one year in jail, a $500 fine or both.</p><p>Pogue’s belongings — including his wallet, ID, phone and equipment — were not returned to him upon his release. He was told he would have to come back to the county jail at 8 a.m. on June 22; when he arrived that Monday officers informed him that his two cameras, three lenses, cellphone, memory cards, camera bag and bulletproof vest were all being held as evidence.</p><p>“Obviously all they would really need is my compact flash card, nothing else really matters,” Pogue said. “It’s just harassment. There’s no intel to be gathered from my lenses.”</p><p>“I am deprived of the tools of my trade for no good reason,” he added.</p><p>Tristan Ahtone, editor-in-chief for the Observer, told the Tracker, “We condemn the arrest of reporters by security forces and demand that Tulsa police release [Pogue’s] equipment immediately.”</p><p>Pogue said that his arraignment is set for July 10, but that he is hopeful the charges will be dismissed and his equipment returned before that date.</p></div></div>",,https://pressfreedomtracker.us/media/images/RTS3ERX1.2e16d0ba.fill-1330x880.jpg,None,"<p>The exterior of Tulsa’s BOK Center, where President Donald Trump held his first re-election campaign rally in many months on June 20, 2020.</p>",arrested and released,charges pending,None,None,False,None,in custody,False,law enforcement,None,False,None,False,False,None,None,None,None,None,None,None,False,None,[],None,None,None,None,None,None,,,obstructing a public officer,,,,,

In the brief, they argue that the subpoena not only violates the First Amendment and the Washington state shield law, but is also overly broad and places an undue burden on the outlets.</p><p>“SPD, acting through outside counsel, has targeted Seattle’s five largest news outlets with an expansive demand for vast amounts of unaired news footage and unpublished news photographs,” Eric Stahl, lawyer for the outlets, wrote in the brief. “The Subpoena is a procedurally irregular, overbroad and impermissible assault on the independence of the press.”</p><p>In an <a href=""https://www.rcfp.org/briefs-comments/seattle-police-subpoena-amicus/"">amicus brief</a> filed the same day, the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press highlighted the dangers of degrading the public’s perception of the media as independent from the government, especially law enforcement.</p><p>“Enforcement of the Subpoena could mislead the public into perceiving reporters at protests as a mere arm of law enforcement,” RCFP’s brief states, “thus eroding public trust in the news media and increasing the already-significant risk of physical harm that journalists face when covering protests.”</p><p>RCFP, a partner of the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker, highlighted the recent case of Arizona journalist Eric Rosenwald, who was <a href=""https://pressfreedomtracker.us/all-incidents/individuals-protest-tucson-target-journalist-repeated-physical-attacks/"">repeatedly pushed, punched and kicked</a> by individuals at a demonstration in Tucson who accused him of being “with the police.”</p><p>Similarly, the Times <a href=""https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/seattle-times-other-media-fight-seattle-police-department-subpoena-for-raw-footage-photos-of-protest/"">reported</a> that one of the outlet’s photographers was punched in the face by an individual at a recent protest, and that newspaper staff members have had to repeatedly explain that they are independent.</p><p>As of press time, the judge had not responded to the outlets’ request to quash the subpoena.</p><p>Brain Esler, an outside attorney representing the police department, told the Times that no actions will be taken to enforce the subpoena until a July 16 Superior Court hearing and subsequent ruling. Esler did not respond to the Tracker’s emailed request for comment.</p></div></div>",,https://pressfreedomtracker.us/media/images/Seattle_Subpoena.2e16d0ba.fill-1330x880.png,None,"<p>A portion of the subpoena demanding raw photos and videos captured by five Seattle-area media outlets during a protest on May 30, 2020.</p>",None,None,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,None,False,None,False,False,None,None,None,None,None,None,None,False,journalist communications or work product,['PENDING'],None,None,None,None,None,None,"KCPQ 13 News, KING 5 News, KIRO 7 News, KOMO 4 News, The Seattle Times",,,,,,,

There was tension between the protesters and police on June 9, Lamar said in his <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/doverpost/videos/695870007915620/"">reporting</a> on Facebook Live, but the protest remained non-violent.</p><p>The <a href=""https://doverpolice.org/2020/06/10/dover-police-statement-regarding-june-9th-actions-with-delaware-state-police/"">Dover Police</a> claimed the protesters had become “more hostile” to motorists and pedestrians in recent days, leading to 911 calls and nearly missed traffic accidents. According to the <a href=""https://dsp.delaware.gov/2020/06/10/update-delaware-state-police-investigating-disorderly-group-resulting-in-several-arrests-camden/"">Delaware State Police</a>, the situation on June 9 escalated when a police vehicle was not allowed to pass and the officer exited the vehicle. Law enforcement warned the protesters to stop blocking traffic and get off the road, the state police statement said.</p><p>Lamar captured his detention on a <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/doverpost/videos/3598774303482628/"">Facebook Live</a> video posted around 6:30 p.m. In the video, Lamar films as officers arrest protesters on the grass next to the road. The officers “slammed them down to the ground,” Lamar says in the video. “There are people laying down on the ground right now and we don’t know why.”</p><p>In the video, Lamar asks officers why they are arresting protesters. But he does not get an answer. He appears to place the camera down on the grass. Seconds later, Lamar begins to ask “Sir, why are people…” when a Dover Police officer grabs him suddenly.</p><p>“I’m with the press!

Throughout the week some protesters had been armed, Dover Police said.</p><p>Suddenly the officer charges at Lamar and grabs him. Two other Dover Police officers nearby assist in restraining Lamar.</p><p>“I can’t breathe! I can’t breathe!” Lamar says to the officers in his Facebook Live video. Officers tell him to stop resisting. “I have a press badge on,” Lamar says.</p><p>“You may, but you gotta listen to us, OK?

Lamar addresses his audience. “You’ve got no help here,” an officer says. “The best thing you can do is be quiet, alright?”</p><p>For at least nine times in two minutes, Lamar identifies as a journalist. The livestream ends as an officer places Lamar’s camera into his bag.</p><p>Lamar and 21 others were taken into custody and transported to Delaware State Police Troop 3, the state and Dover Police said. Lamar was released without charge after police confirmed he was working as a journalist.</p><p>One other individual was released without charge.

Rebel News featured her coverage on a special page, <a href=""http://www.stopantifa.com/"">stopantifa.com</a>.</p><p>Slatz first reported from protests outside the White House in Washington, D.C. She said in a<a href=""https://www.rebelnews.com/rubber_bullets_in_dc_mounted_police_push_back_protest_after_warnings""> June 2 report</a> that she was nearly arrested by a charging police officer, but he passed her by after she yelled out that she was a journalist.</p><p>On June 2, she was following a couple thousand protesters<a href=""https://twitter.com/YesThatAnna/status/1267961005927211018""> march</a> through Manhattan when she stopped to film a chaotic scene at a Zara clothing store around 9 p.m., she told the Tracker. The glass <a href=""https://twitter.com/YesThatAnna/status/1267985169488777216"">entrance</a> was shattered. Some were stealing. Others were throwing clothes in the air. One protester body-slammed someone emerging from the store with stolen goods. And then the police swept in making mass arrests.</p><p>In<a href=""https://www.rebelnews.com/nypd_ignored_looters_arrested_bystanders_including_me""> video</a> of her arrest published by Rebel News after her release, Slatz was soon confronted by several officers screaming for people to go home. The video shows Slatz amid a group of people, including green-hatted National Lawyers Guild legal observers, being forcefully ushered off the block.</p><p>An officer pushed Slatz hard against her chest with his baton, she told the Tracker. An officer then grabbed her by the throat and shoved her into the street, she said. The video is unclear, but a hand of an officer can be seen reaching out toward Slatz. She shrieks as the footage shakes violently, then stumbles into the crosswalk.</p><p>An officer approaches and waves at her to keep moving, the video shows. She crosses to the other side of the street, where another officer orders two officers to arrest her. They don’t immediately react to the order, so the officer repeats it more aggressively.</p><p>“No! No! Media is exempted! Media is exempted!” Slatz yells in the video. An officer pulls out handcuffs as Slatz pleads, “Stop, stop, stop!” Then the video cuts out.</p><p>The officers brought her to the ground, breaking her glasses, she<a href=""https://twitter.com/YesThatAnna/status/1269380409365757953""> reported</a> after her release.</p><p>In the face of the unrest, New York had imposed an 8 p.m. <a href=""https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/home/downloads/pdf/executive-orders/2020/eeo-119.pdf"">curfew</a>, which excluded essential workers, including <a href=""https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/no-2026-continuing-temporary-suspension-and-modification-laws-relating-disaster-emergency"">news media</a>. Slatz told the Tracker she repeatedly identified herself as a journalist. But as a new reporter for Rebel News, she had yet to receive a hard press credential from the outlet, though she had a printed copy of it, she said.</p><p>She also said that the NYPD had stopped issuing press credentials. On June 6, Mayor Bill de Blasio <a href=""https://twitter.com/NYCMayor/status/1269383306702917633"">tweeted</a> that “being in a crisis is no excuse” for the NYPD to stop processing applications for press credentials. He said he directed the NYPD to expedite applications.</p><p>Slatz was taken to Brooklyn Central Booking for processing, she told the Tracker. She was placed in a small cell with some 20 other women, packed “back to chest like sardines” without masks. She was told she would be given a summons and released.</p><p>Instead, she was transferred to Manhattan Central Booking around 3 a.m. She would remain there without soap, running water, or a bed until her release on June 4, she said. Other women in her cell had been held even longer.</p><p>Slatz managed to call her employer on the first night of her arrest, who hired several lawyers, including Michael Weinstock, a New Yorker currently running for Congress.</p><p>Weinstock filed papers declaring himself Slatz’s lawyer, but due to a likely clerical error, the court appointed a public defender to represent Slatz during her arraignment on June 4, Weinstock and Slatz told the Tracker. The precautions necessary for the coronavirus and the sheer number of recent arrests severely strained the system, Weinstock said.</p><p>Slatz said she was released on a charge of obstructing traffic. Her next court date was scheduled for Sept. 3, she said.</p><p>The NYPD and Mayor de Blasio’s office did not respond to requests for comment. The Manhattan district attorney <a href=""https://www.manhattanda.org/d-a-vance-declines-to-prosecute-protest-arrests/"">announced</a> in a press release on June 5 that his office would not prosecute unlawful assembly or disorderly conduct arrests.

Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man, died when a white police officer kneeled on his neck for more than 8 minutes during an arrest.</p><p>Snyder was covering demonstrations in Little Rock on the evening of June 2 when he was caught up in a group of protesters detained by police on a pedestrian bridge, <a href=""https://katv.com/news/local/4th-night-of-protests-at-arkansas-state-capitol"">according to KATV</a>. Police detained the group at around 10 p.m., two hours after a curfew went into effect.</p><p>Snyder was <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/arkansasonline/videos/3148425058553610/"">livestreaming the protests</a> on the Democrat-Gazette’s Facebook page. In his video, a group of protesters can be seen being led by police to a pedestrian bridge, and Snyder identified himself as press to officers he passed. As they arrived, Snyder shouted out “press!” but no law-enforcement officers appeared to notice, and police ordered the group of protesters to the ground.</p><p>At one point in the video, Snyder takes a call from a colleague, telling them, “I think I’m being arrested.”</p><p>Several protesters are visible in the video around him, also on the ground. After more than 10 minutes, he can be heard identifying himself as a journalist to an officer.</p><p>“I just wanted to give a heads up, I’m press, I don’t know if anybody heard that during all the commotion,” he said.</p><p>The officer said that he would need to speak with a different officer. A short time later, after several other people can be seen being led away with their hands zip-tied behind his back, police appear in the video to let others in the group, including Snyder, disperse.</p><p>Snyder referred the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker to Democrat-Gazette Managing Editor Eliza Gaines for comment on the incident.</p><p>“I honestly think that the police did not hear him,” Gaines said, noting it was very loud.</p><p>Gaines said editors had verified with the city earlier in the day that reporters would be exempt from the curfew. Gaines said Snyder was carrying credentials and showed them to police after he had made his presence known.</p><p>In response to the incident, Gaines contacted the city the following day to establish a point of contact in case other reporters were detained. She said the city was “very responsive” and immediately gave a contact’s phone number for editors to call if it happened again.</p><p>Two other journalists, <a href=""https://pressfreedomtracker.us/all-incidents/katv-journalist-detained-while-livestreaming-little-rock-protests/"">Paige Cushman</a> and <a href=""https://pressfreedomtracker.us/all-incidents/katv-reporter-detained-while-covering-little-rock-protests/"">Kaitlin Barger</a> of the local ABC affiliate KATV, also were detained on the bridge while they were streaming on Facebook Live.</p><p>Arkansas State Police spokesman Bill Sadler said in an emailed statement that the journalists were “embedded” with a group of protesters who police say were damaging public and private property, and didn’t notify police that they would be with the group. According to Sadler, police were told that at least one person among the protesters had a handgun.</p><p>Sadler said police became aware of the reporters after the group had been “cordoned off” and ordered to the ground.</p><p>“Only then were voices heard in the group...claiming to be news reporters,” he said. “Once the scene was secure, and guns were removed from two individuals, police did assist the reporters in being separated from the group as they requested.”</p><p>Gaines disputed Sadler’s characterization of Snyder as “embedded” with protesters. “He was covering the protests,” she said in an email.</p><p>In its report on the incident, KATV said the journalists “repeatedly identified themselves as reporters, showed their credentials and complied with officers&#x27; orders.”</p><p>The U.S. Press Freedom Tracker is documenting several hundred incidents of journalists assaulted, arrested, struck by crowd control ammunition or tear gas or had their equipment damaged while covering protests across the country related to the death of George Floyd and others while in police custody.

After recruiting more participants at City Hall, the group <a href=""https://www.kqed.org/news/11822543/civil-liberties-advocates-raise-concerns-about-curfews-imposed-across-bay-area"">marched</a> to the Hall of Justice to perform a peaceful sit-in after the 8 p.m. curfew.</p><p>Sato covered the march on her <a href=""https://twitter.com/IAmSakuraSF/status/1268031100208574467"">social</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/IAmSakuraSF/status/1268017523238170624"">media</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/IAmSakuraSF/status/1268043847210156032"">accounts</a>, she told the Tracker. The dual crises of the Floyd protests and the coronavirus pandemic had recently inspired her to pursue a career in journalism, she said. But she was not on assignment for an outlet that night.</p><p>San Francisco police followed the march and formed a cordon around the protesters after they arrived at the Hall of Justice, Sheraz Sadiq, a producer for local NPR and PBS affiliate KQED who was also covering the march, told the Tracker.</p><p>Sato and Sadiq were both stuck inside the cordon as they reported on the sit-in, now about 30 people strong. Around 9:30 p.m., police warned over a megaphone that the protesters were in violation of curfew and ordered them to disperse, Sadiq said. But protesters, ignoring the warnings, responded with chants like “I don’t see no riot here. Why are you in riot gear?”</p><p>In a <a href=""https://twitter.com/SherazSadiq1/status/1268051221224419328"">video</a> tweeted by Sadiq just before 10:30, police can be seen arresting the protesters one by one.

Sato can be seen observing police take away a protester.</p><p>Shortly thereafter, Sato was also arrested. She told the Tracker that a group of officers approached her, said she was under arrest and asked if she would resist. She responded that she was a journalist. She was placed in zip ties anyway and taken to a transport vehicle.</p><p>“I said I am a member of the press, and they ignored that,” Sato said.</p><p>The city’s <a href=""https://sfmayor.org/article/mayor-london-breed-and-public-safety-officials-announce-curfew-san-francisco-begin-tonight-8#:~:text=Breed%2C%20in%20consultation%20with%20the,Monday%2C%20June%201%2C%202020."">curfew order</a> excluded “authorized representatives of any news service, newspaper, radio or television station or network, or other media organization.”</p><p>“The thing that really upset me was that she was obviously functioning as a reporter,” protest organizer Williams said. “There was no reason why she should’ve been arrested alongside us. It’s insane to me.”</p><p>Footage from the protest filmed by the <a href=""https://twitter.com/FitzTheReporter/status/1268041685742673920"">KQED</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/SherazSadiq1/status/1268048423535603712"">journalists</a> and <a href=""https://twitter.com/DSA_SF/status/1268044059223879680"">protesters</a> show Sato always standing apart from the protesters, observing and documenting, never participating.</p><p>“The police in San Francisco in my experience are loath to make allowances for citizen journalists or for journalists in training,” Fitzgerald Rodriguez, who is also the vice president of the Northern California chapter of the Society for Professional Journalists, told the Tracker. “They tend to only respect a credentialed journalist or a journalist with a SFPD-issued press pass.”</p><p>Sato had not yet acquired press credentials. Michael Applegate, the executive officer of the Pacific Media Workers Guild, said Sato had just joined the Guild Freelancers. The union expedited sending her a press card after her arrest.</p><p>Police officers also <a href=""https://pressfreedomtracker.us/all-incidents/kqed-journalist-briefly-detained-another-journalist-arrested-covering-sit-against-san-francisco-curfew/"">briefly detained Sadiq</a> after the protesters and Sato were in custody, Sadiq and Fitzgerald Rodriguez told the Tracker. Sadiq, who had a KQED press ID, was released after officers verified his credentials.</p><p>Sato told the Tracker she began to feel sick as soon as she sat down in the police transport vehicle. The zip ties constricted the blood flow to her wrists, and she began to feel weak.</p><p>Williams, who was also arrested and placed in the van, said that the protesters asked the officers to take Sato out first when they arrived at Pier 50 for processing.</p><p>Sato was given a citation on charges of violating curfew and resisting, delaying or obstructing a public officer or peace officer. An officer warned her that if she was arrested again for the same reason, she could be put in jail, she said. Her possessions, which had been confiscated upon her arrest, were returned to her, and she was released after several hours in custody.</p><p>Williams said the protesters were released on the same charges.</p><p>Rachel Marshall, a spokesperson for San Francisco District Attorney Chesa Boudin, said Sato’s case was discharged. She said Boudin “deeply values the First Amendment—including its protection of the press,” adding that Boudin supports the protests against police brutality and will not prosecute peaceful activity.</p><p>As of June 19, Sato said she had not heard official confirmation that her case was dropped.</p><p>A SFPD spokesperson said the department was reviewing body camera footage but did not respond to specific questions about Sato&#x27;s arrest and Sadiq&#x27;s detention by press time.</p><p>The U.S. Press Freedom Tracker is documenting several hundred incidents of journalists assaulted, arrested, struck by crowd control ammunition or tear gas or had their equipment damaged while covering protests across the country.

After recruiting more participants at City Hall, the group <a href=""https://www.kqed.org/news/11822543/civil-liberties-advocates-raise-concerns-about-curfews-imposed-across-bay-area"">marched</a> to the Hall of Justice to perform a peaceful sit-in after the 8 p.m. curfew.</p><p>San Francisco police followed the march and formed a cordon around the protesters after they arrived at the Hall of Justice, Sadiq told the Tracker.</p><p>Not wanting to be confused for a protester, Sadiq showed officers his credentials and told them he was working for KQED, he said.</p><p>Around 9:30, police warned over a megaphone that the protesters were in violation of curfew and ordered them to disperse, Sadiq said. But protesters, ignoring the warnings, responded with chants like “I don’t see no riot here. Why are you in riot gear?”</p><p>Sadiq said he tried to leave the cordoned area, but an officer blocked his exit. When he identified himself as a journalist, the officer called over a sergeant.</p><p>The sergeant said Sadiq was in a “sanitized zone” and could not leave, according to Sadiq. When Sadiq told the sergeant he was a journalist, the sergeant said they would “sort it out later,” according to Sadiq.</p><p>Rebuffed on one side, Sadiq said he tried to leave on the other side of the cordon. But there, too, he was turned back. Sadiq was stuck inside the cordon with the sit-in, now about 30 people strong.</p><p>In a <a href=""https://twitter.com/SherazSadiq1/status/1268051221224419328"">video</a> tweeted by Sadiq just before 10:30, police can be seen arresting the protesters one by one. Protesters cheer in support each time it is the next protester’s turn to stand, put their hands behind their back and walk away in the custody of the San Francisco Police Department.</p><p>The city’s <a href=""https://sfmayor.org/article/mayor-london-breed-and-public-safety-officials-announce-curfew-san-francisco-begin-tonight-8#:~:text=Breed%2C%20in%20consultation%20with%20the,Monday%2C%20June%201%2C%202020."">curfew order</a> excluded “authorized representatives of any news service, newspaper, radio or television station or network, or other media organization.”</p><p>But freelance journalist Sakura Sato, who was also inside the cordon, <a href=""https://pressfreedomtracker.us/all-incidents/journalists-detained-one-arrested-covering-protest-against-san-francisco-curfew/"">was arrested</a> with the protesters despite identifying as a journalist, she told the Tracker. Sato, who recently decided to pursue journalism, had not yet acquired press credentials.</p><p>Sadiq, who had a press ID from KQED, was treated differently. With all the protesters and Sato under arrest, only Sadiq remained inside the police cordon. Two officers approached him.</p><p>“They looked a little bit confused. They had to check with each other. Like, should we get him?” Sadiq explained. “Then I stepped back and they said, ‘Sir, you are going to have to come with us.’”</p><p>Sadiq asked why, and the officers said that he was not under arrest but detained until they could check his credentials. The officers asked if Sadiq would resist. He said no, but voiced his disagreement about what was happening, he told the Tracker.</p><p>“Joe, I’m being arrested!” Sadiq yelled out to his KQED colleague Joe Fitzgerald Rodriguez, who was reporting across the street. Fitzgerald Rodriguez remained outside the cordon but was flanked by officers.</p><p>“What did I tell you?” one of the officers responded, according to Sadiq. “You’re not being arrested. You’re just being detained.”</p><p>The officers took Sadiq to a staging area, where he was asked to provide his driver’s license. Sadiq removed the face mask he was wearing to help confirm his identity, he said.</p><p>Sadiq said he asked why he was being detained, and the officers responded that he disobeyed the dispersal order. When Sadiq said he was a working journalist exempt from the curfew order, the police said that protesters had falsely been claiming to be journalists in an attempt to evade arrest.</p><p>Sadiq said he was released after about 15 minutes.</p><p>Fitzgerald Rodriguez told the Tracker that he shouted across the street trying to vouch for his detained colleague. Eventually an officer, who he believes was a sergeant, crossed the street to talk to him before returning to Sadiq.</p><p>Sato and the protesters were released with a citation on charges of violating curfew and resisting, delaying or obstructing a public officer or peace officer, Sato and Williams, the DSA member, told the Tracker.</p><p>Rachel Marshall, a spokesperson for San Francisco District Attorney Chesa Boudin, said the cases were discharged. She said Boudin “deeply values the First Amendment—including its protection of the press,” adding that Boudin supports the protests against police brutality and will not prosecute peaceful activity.</p><p>A SFPD spokesperson said the department was reviewing body camera footage but did not respond to specific questions about Sato&#x27;s arrest and Sadiq&#x27;s detention by press time.</p><p>Sadiq said the police treated him politely but the incident left him questioning why his detention was necessary at all.</p><p>“It’s not like this was a melee, a chaotic scene that was unfolding, and in the scrum of the confusion, they swept up everybody,” Sadiq explained. “This was a very orderly, very well-organized demonstration.”</p><p>Yet once someone is inside the police cordon, Sadiq said, they seemed to be treated “almost like an enemy combatant” that the police must “screen and verify and go through their protocols, including detention and possibly arrest.”</p><p>Sadiq, who is of South Asian heritage, said he did not see any evidence of racial prejudice during his detention. But he worried throughout that his name would end up on a list that could cause trouble in the future.</p><p>“As a person of color, especially with the protests that are engulfing the nation around racial inequity, this is a conversation or a monologue sometimes people of color have, especially when being subject to interactions with law enforcement,” Sadiq said.</p><p>The U.S. Press Freedom Tracker is documenting several hundred incidents of journalists assaulted, arrested, struck by crowd control ammunition or tear gas or had their equipment damaged while covering protests across the country.

Floyd was later pronounced dead in a hospital.</p><p>The officer has been charged with second-degree murder. Three other officers who were present face felony charges.</p><p>The protest in central Los Angeles began at the Getty House, the mayor’s residence, before the city-wide curfew at 6:30 p.m., Helou-Hernandez told the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker. Some protestors wanted to continue demonstrating past curfew and Helou-Hernandez stayed to document them. Around 7:30 p.m., about 100 protesters marched through Hancock Park before turning onto Wilshire Boulevard where they were met by police in riot gear.</p><p>Helou-Hernandez followed the group of protesters onto a side street. Someone yelled, “they’re shooting,” and Helou-Hernandez said she followed a smaller contingent of around a dozen people onto another side street, where they were cornered by officers with the Los Angeles Police Department. Helou-Hernandez was cuffed with zip ties. When she told the police that she was press, they moved her aside. She explained that she didn’t have press credentials because she was a freelancer and offered to show LAPD her clips and website on her phone.</p><p>According to Helou-Hernandez, an officer said something to the effect of, “If you’re press, why did you run away from us? You should have run toward us” if you thought there was shooting. At this point, Helou-Hernandez and protesters were brought to a second location to join a larger group of about 20-30 handcuffed protesters. The officers called their names and directed them to form lines. The group was sent to a third location on 8th and Crenshaw where buses would take them to the precinct.</p><p>Lexis-Olivier Ray, a journalist for L.A. Taco, was at 8th and Crenshaw documenting arrests. Ray was already in touch with a police supervisor because he and an L.A. Taco colleague had been barred from crossing the police line. Ray heard Helou-Hernandez calling his name.</p><p>“I grabbed the attention of the supervisor who I had been talking to already ... and I bring his attention to the fact that my friend and fellow journalist Sami is in custody,” Ray said. He also showed the LAPD her website and clips.</p><p>At 9:36 p.m. Ray <a href=""https://twitter.com/ShotOn35mm/status/1268038752628174848"">tweeted</a> a video of Helou-Hernandez in zip ties with the caption, “My friend and fellow journalist<a href=""https://twitter.com/Samanta_Helou""> @Samanta_Helou</a> is currently in custody.<a href=""https://twitter.com/LAPDHQ""> @LAPDHQ</a> is trying to verify her identity.

Floyd was pronounced dead at a local hospital. Protests against police brutality and in support of the Black Lives Matter movement have been held across the United States since the end of May.</p><p>Wilson had been covering the protest in front of the Colorado Springs police headquarters with a KKTV photographer, Jon Modic, all day, and broadcast much of the demonstrations on <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?v=329636514690916&amp;ref=watch_permalink"">Facebook Live</a>. The pair were reporting from a barricade in front of the police headquarters, where about 75 people were protesting and about 40 police officers were standing on the other side, Wilson told the Committee to Protect Journalists.</p><p>At around 10:30 p.m., an announcement came over a loudspeaker informing the crowd that the protest was no longer peaceful, and that protesters needed to leave. Wilson heard the same announcement while covering protests the previous night, June 1. On both nights, the announcement angered the crowd, Wilson said, and he saw bottles being thrown at police officers.</p><p>At this point, Wilson was standing with Shawn Shanle, a photographer for FOX 21, and he began moving back as officers with riot shields moved toward the crowd. Wilson estimated no more than two minutes passed between the dispersal order and the police moving in on the crowd. Then, fireworks exploded and police shouted, “That was not us!” Officers then began pepper spraying the crowd.</p><p>“I’m walking away from the police. I turn around to start walking backwards, like I’m in a marching band, while I’m holding up my camera on my shoulder,” Wilson said. “A police officer, who is on the very edge of the line, just randomly sprays pepper spray as if it was silly string.”</p><p>Wilson said the officer looked directly at him when he sprayed from about 10 yards away. “It was directly aimed at me and that photographer and it wafted over to us and went directly into us.”</p><p>Wilson said he was clearly identifiable as a member of the media. He had a large camera on his shoulder, was dressed in a suit and tie, and was wearing a media I.D. on a lanyard.</p><p>Wilson also had visited the police station earlier in the day to ask where journalists should report from, and where they should move to in the event of a dispersal. When told to disperse, Wilson walked in the direction the police had told him to go earlier in the day.</p><p>After he was sprayed, Wilson turned the camera at the police, repeated that he was media, and asked the officer why he sprayed. Wilson says the officer was silent, and continued chasing after protesters who were walking away. Wilson didn’t get the name of the officer, and said he didn’t know whether he had been targeted as a member of the press.</p><p>After being sprayed, Wilson said he was separately hit with tear gas deployed by police. A police officer led Wilson — coughing and with eyes stinging from the chemicals — away from the street. He used a water bottle given to him by a protester to wash out his eyes and finished reporting at around midnight.</p><p>A spokesperson for the Colorado Springs Police Department declined to comment on the incident, but said the department worked with the media to address safety concerns. The department also <a href=""https://twitter.com/CSPDPIO/status/1268277781609148416"">said</a> on Twitter that demonstrators are ordered to disperse only when protests turn violent.</p><p>In a message sent to members of the media on June 3, the Colorado Springs Police Department said, “Please know that you are never targeted because you are press. When officers are working to safely disperse a crowd, they cannot differentiate media in the crowd (as many protestors also have cameras), and are working to disperse everyone present.” The message goes on to ask reporters to wear clothing that clearly identifies them as press, and that journalists have their credentials on them at all times.</p><p>The next day, Wilson’s boss bought goggles and reflective vests for journalists to wear for future assignments, so police could more easily identify them. Wilson said he went back to the Colorado Springs police headquarters and told officers about the vests.</p><p>“The officers I spoke with laughed and said, ‘It’s not going to help.’ I was taken aback.”</p><p>The U.S. Press Freedom Tracker is documenting several hundred incidents of journalists being assaulted, arrested, struck by crowd-control ammunition or tear gas, or having their equipment damaged while covering protests across the country.

Police escorted him to a van transporting arrested protesters.</p><p>On the way to the van, an officer asked Martínez Contreras what was hanging around his neck, Martínez Contreras wrote. His press badge, he replied.

Reporter Jeff Neiburg and photographer Jenna Miller of Wilmington’s The News Journal and Delaware Online were also arrested by Philadelphia police as they attempted to return home after the 6 p.m. curfew, the outlet<a href=""https://www.delawareonline.com/story/opinion/editorials/2020/06/02/reporters-must-not-charged-detained-they-cover-protests-editorial/3123063001/""> reported</a>.</p><p>Their respective outlets said the three journalists were reporting on protests that began in Minnesota on May 26 and spread across the country, sparked by a video showing a police officer kneeling on the neck of George Floyd, a black man, during an arrest the day before. Floyd was later pronounced dead at a hospital.</p><p>Graham, a Pulitzer Prize-winning education reporter, volunteered to cover the protests that day, she said in a<a href=""https://www.inquirer.com/news/george-floyd-protests-philadelphia-jouranlist-arrested-kristen-graham-20200602.html""> personal account</a> written for the Inquirer. Police deployed tear gas around 5 p.m. into a crowd near Graham. She continued to report despite the stinging in her eyes.</p><p>As the curfew set in by 6 p.m. and the protesters dissipated, Graham wrote that she decided to walk back to her car near the <i>Inquirer</i> office. After passing dozens of police officers, one approached her to ask where she was going. The officer urged her to keep her press credentials prominently displayed. So she did.</p><p>After she photographed some police buses near City Hall, another officer told her she was not allowed there. So Graham turned around to walk the other way around the building.</p><p>A minute later, she wrote, two officers confronted her and put her hands behind her back. Despite Graham trying to explain she was a reporter, the officers cuffed her in zip ties. Graham told the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker that the officers placed her helmet and phone inside her backpack.</p><p>The<a href=""https://www.phila.gov/documents/emergency-order-to-implement-curfew/""> curfew order</a> explicitly excludes working media as essential personnel. But Graham told the Tracker that the officers “brushed aside” her explanation that she was working as a journalist.</p><p>Graham wrote in her account for the Inquirer that she was brought to an empty bus that soon was filled with more than 20 women, including Miller from The News Journal. Like Graham, Miller and Neiburg were detained near City Hall and brought to buses segregated by gender, Neiburg said in an <a href=""https://975thefanatic.com/episodes/delware-onlines-jeff-neiburg-breaks-down-the-protests/"">interview</a> with the local radio station 97.5 The Fanatic. The journalists, with the other detainees, were then driven to the 22nd District Headquarters.</p><p>Graham told the Tracker that she was brought into the station for processing. But a police supervisor told the officers there was no room and ordered her taken back to the bus.</p><p>For two hours, the journalists remained on the buses, their outlets reported. In her Inquirer account, Graham described how the buses were not air conditioned and one woman urinated herself after not being allowed to use the bathroom. Another woman had a medical emergency and was eventually taken to receive medical care.</p><p>An officer informed the detainees on Graham and Miller’s bus they would be issued citations for violating the curfew and released by the end of the night, both journalists <a href=""https://twitter.com/jennamargaretta/status/1267635481317183488"">said</a>.</p><p>Graham wrote in the Inquirer that she was eventually able to maneuver her hands in order to send texts to her husband and editor on her smartwatch.

With a short staff due to furloughs, he was recruited to help cover the protests that swept through Cincinnati and the rest of the nation after the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody on May 25.</p><p>Cincinnati police began to enforce a<a href=""https://twitter.com/HCEMA/status/1267537596164517889""> curfew</a> shortly after 8 p.m., the paper<a href=""https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/2020/06/01/cincinnati-enquirer-journalist-detained-during-protest-coverage/5313869002/""> reported</a>. A video provided by Brennan shows a SWAT vehicle advancing as a loudspeaker blares warnings to leave the streets or face arrest. Protesters run away from the police line. Brennan decided to stay put, identify as a journalist, and let the police pass, he told the Tracker.</p><p>His colleague Maddie Mitchell told the Enquirer that Brennan was separated from the group and she called out to him to rejoin. But he suddenly disappeared from view as he crossed behind a police vehicle.</p><p>Brennan had crossed behind the vehicle on the orders of the police, his video shows. Brennan records police arresting two people. One officer tells Brennan to “do what you want but back up.” Brennan says he is trying to reconnect with his crew. An officer says to go on the other side of the vehicle. So Brennan crossed to the other side of the street and sought a way to reconnect with his colleagues, he told the Tracker.</p><p>The detention was captured in two videos filmed by other media present.</p><p>Courtney Francisco, a senior journalist with the local ABC affiliate WCPO,<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/CA8kpkHpbVU/""> posted</a> on her social media a video that begins moments before police took Brennan into custody.</p><p>In the video, two police officers warn Francisco and the WCPO crew to leave the area. “Sir, we are with the news,” she says. “I know but we need space,” one officer responds before warning her again to get back.</p><p>Within a minute, the camera swings towards a commotion and records at least seven officers taking Brennan to the ground. As an officer pulls out plastic restraints to cuff Brennan, Francisco gets quickly caught up herself. The two police officers who previously warned her begin shoving her backwards. The officers force the crew around the corner of a building and out of sight of Brennan.</p><p>“They were pushing very hard and very fast. I couldn’t keep up,” she says to the camera.</p><p>Nick Swartsell, a journalist on furlough from the Cincinnati CityBeat, posted a<a href=""https://twitter.com/nswartsell/status/1267612155840528385""> video</a> on Twitter showing Brennan walk by a police SWAT vehicle toward the police line. Police officers stop Brennan, who is wearing a mask, goggles, and a badge around his neck. A police loudspeaker blares “He’s been told” before the officers take him to the ground.</p><p>Brennan told the Tracker he did his best to avoid face-planting as one officer stuck his leg out to trip him. He collapsed to the ground with the officers, who shoved his cheek into the pavement and cuffed him. Police then brought him to a wall where others were being held.</p><p>The police released Brennan from custody without charge after 30 minutes, according to the Enquirer.</p><p>That night Brennan said on<a href=""https://twitter.com/PBrennanENQ/status/1267656078067720198""> Twitter</a> that he had a “respectful conversation” with Cincinnati’s chief of police, Eliot Isaac. Brennan told the Tracker that Isaac arrived on scene and immediately went to apologize to Brennan.</p><p>The police department <a href=""https://twitter.com/CincyPD/status/1267629539980648451"">apologized</a> on Twitter for “any inconvenience” regarding Brennan’s detention and Francisco’s removal from the area. According to<a href=""https://twitter.com/nswartsell/status/1267622449115467778""> Swartsell</a>, Isaac said Brennan “got mixed up in the crowd,” claiming he was wearing goggles and a mask without an obvious ID.</p><p>Lt. Steve Saunders, a spokesman for the Cincinnati police department, told the Tracker on June 10 that the department had entered ongoing conversations with media outlets to help better identify journalists and ensure they can report while not interfering in police operations. “If we can do things better, we want to do things better,” he said, while insisting that this applies to journalists, too.</p><p>Cincinnati Mayor John Cranley also <a href=""https://twitter.com/JohnCranley/status/1267628761027141634"">apologized</a> on Twitter, calling the arrest a “big mistake” and stating that reporters are crucial to democracy.</p><p>Francisco and Swartsell did not respond to emailed requests for comment.</p><p>The U.S. Press Freedom Tracker is documenting several hundred total incidents of journalists assaulted, arrested, struck by crowd control ammunition or tear gas or had their equipment damaged while covering protests across the country related to the death of George Floyd while in police custody.

Floyd was later pronounced dead at a hospital.</p><p>June 1 was <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2020/06/01/us/ap-us-america-protests-officers-struck.html?searchResultPosition=20"">a particularly chaotic night in Buffalo</a>. At one point, an SUV carrying two people who had been shot drove through a line of law enforcement officers, two of whom suffered injuries and were taken to a hospital. Blocks away from that incident, police deployed tear gas to clear the streets. In the midst of that, WIVB reporter Dave Greber and photographer Brad Berchou were caught in a volley of pepper ball fire from police. One of the projectiles hit the camera lens, but it was not damaged.</p><p>In an interview with WIVB, Greber said that he did not believe he and Berchou were targeted because they were journalists. “I think they were firing at anything that moved. And we happened to be moving,” he said. “I would hope, to be honest with you, that they didn’t know who we were. It would be a real shame that if they identified us as media positively, and then pulled the trigger.”</p><p>At a press conference, Buffalo police captain Jeff Rinaldo said that any harm journalists suffered during the protests from police was incidental. “We try as hard as we can to make sure that members of the media have access to these events. But when situations like this unfold, when we’re trying to disperse large crowds, there is the potential for media members to become part of the situation,” he said.</p><p>Earlier that evening, a protester giving an on-camera interview to WIVB in front of a line of police with his arms raised above his head was tackled to the ground from behind by officers in riot gear. A New York State Police spokesperson told the station that the man was a “protest antagonist” responsible for instigating the crowd and that officers did not realize the man was being interviewed when they moved to make the arrest. That was just moments before the SUV drove through the line of officers.</p><p>The U.S. Press Freedom Tracker is documenting damage of equipment and multiple journalists arrested or struck by crowd control ammunition or tear gas while covering related protests across the country.

She heard an officer instruct others to arrest any protester who tried to go down an embankment toward the interstate, she said.</p><p>As the Georgia State Patrol began to make arrests, Pointer said she continued to photograph the scene. After she captured the arrest of two young women, an officer from the DNR demanded to know what she was doing.</p><p>The department, which usually provides law enforcement for outdoor recreation, was one of several state and local agencies assisting the Atlanta Police Department that day, DNR spokesperson Mark McKinnon told the Tracker.</p><p>Pointer responded that she was a journalist with the Atlanta Journal-Constitution and said she was heading back up the embankment. Pointer’s press badge hung clearly visible around her neck, she said.</p><p>“I don’t care. You’re being detained,” the DNR officer said, according to Pointer. Two other officers followed that order and proceeded to detain her.</p><p>McKinnon said that two Atlanta Police Department officers told DNR officers to arrest everyone in the area where protesters were blocking traffic on the highway. DNR officers detained Pointer as part of that group.</p><p>Pointer told the Tracker that the officers were not able to handcuff her due to all of her equipment. So they took her two cameras and backpack and placed her in plastic restraints. They then hung her cameras around her neck.</p><p>Journalists walking among the protesters found Pointer sitting with her back against the support of an underpass surrounded by several DNR officers. In a <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/tvnewsgoon/videos/564953394445546/?v=564953394445546"">livestream video</a> by NBC affiliate 11Alive, reporter Doug Richards spots Pointer and asks, “Whoa, is that Alyssa?”</p><p>Two other journalists were already filming Pointer and talking to the officers. “She’s with the AJC!” Richards shouts in the video. A DNR officer responds that he did not know who detained her or why.</p><p>“It’s as if the story of these guys is that someone cuffed her and then walked away,” Richards explains to his livestream audience.</p><p>A DNR officer, seeing Pointer’s press badge, asked her who detained her. She said she did not know, because the initial officer had left after giving the order. An officer then left to search for his colleague, she said.</p><p>Pointer told the Tracker that one officer offered to write down a phone number for her to call once she was taken to jail. “I kept telling him I’m not going,” Pointer said, repeating that she was a journalist. “But they weren’t listening.”</p><p>McKinnon said a DNR supervisor ordered her release after Pointer provided evidence that she was a journalist.</p><p>Pointer’s restraints were removed; she’d been detained for approximately 10 minutes.</p><p>“Bottom line, I was going to jail if the journalists weren’t there,” Pointer told the Tracker.</p><p>Pointer gathered her things and immediately headed up the street to catch up with the protest.

Philadelphia police arrested reporter Jeff Neiburg and <a href=""https://pressfreedomtracker.us/all-incidents/news-journal-photographer-one-three-journalists-detained-philadelphia-police-past-curfew/"">photographer Jenna Miller</a> as they returned home from reporting around 7 p.m., after the 6 p.m. curfew, Miller <a href=""https://twitter.com/jennamargaretta/status/1267629476034146304"">said in a tweet</a>.</p><p>A third journalist was similarly detained that night in Philadelphia. Kristen Graham, a reporter for the daily Philadelphia Inquirer, was <a href=""https://pressfreedomtracker.us/all-incidents/philadelphia-inquirer-reporter-one-three-journalists-detained-police-past-curfew/"">also arrested</a> by police as she attempted to return to her car soon after the curfew, the paper <a href=""https://www.inquirer.com/news/live/philadelphia-protest-curfew-news-live-george-floyd-minneapolis-looting-stores-police-20200602.html"">reported</a>.</p><p>Their respective outlets said the three journalists were reporting on protests that began in Minnesota on May 26 and spread across the country, sparked by a video showing a police officer kneeling on the neck of George Floyd, a black man, during an arrest the day before. Floyd was later pronounced dead at a hospital.</p><p>As the curfew set in by 6 p.m. and the protesters dispersed, Miller and Neiburg decided to go home and file their reporting, Neiburg said in an <a href=""https://975thefanatic.com/episodes/delware-onlines-jeff-neiburg-breaks-down-the-protests/"">interview</a> with the local radio station 97.5 The Fanatic. Miller’s bike was parked near police headquarters, so they headed in that direction.</p><p>They asked a police officer how to get there safely, who instructed the journalists to walk around the south side of City Hall, Neiburg said in the radio interview. As they walked, they saw police officers arresting people.</p><p>The journalists held their press credentials in the air, Neiburg said in the radio interview.</p><p>“They’re going to round you up, they’re going to round you up,” a group of officers warned the journalists. One of the police officers started to escort Miller and Neiburg out of concern they would be arrested, Neiburg said in the radio interview.</p><p>But two other officers interceded and overruled her, Neiburg said. The journalists were to be detained.</p><p>Miller said in a <a href=""https://twitter.com/jennamargaretta/status/1267629476034146304"">tweet</a> after her release that they repeatedly identified themselves as journalists and showed their press credentials. But officers claimed they were under orders to detain everyone.</p><p>“I don’t believe you,” one officer told the journalists, in reference to their press credentials, according to <a href=""https://www.delawareonline.com/story/opinion/editorials/2020/06/02/reporters-must-not-charged-detained-they-cover-protests-editorial/3123063001/"">Neiburg</a>.</p><p>Miller and Neiburg were placed in plastic restraints and escorted to gender segregated buses, Neiburg said in the radio interview.</p><p>Graham wrote in her account for the Inquirer that she was also arrested near City Hall and brought to an empty bus that soon was filled with more than 20 women, including Miller from The News Journal. The journalists, with the other detainees, were then driven to the 22nd District Headquarters.</p><p>For two hours, the journalists remained on the buses, their outlets reported. In her Inquirer account, Graham described how the buses were not air conditioned and one woman urinated herself after not being allowed to use the bathroom. Another woman had a medical emergency and was eventually taken to receive medical care.</p><p>An officer informed the detainees on Graham and Miller’s bus they would be issued citations for violating the curfew and released by the end of the night, both journalists <a href=""https://twitter.com/jennamargaretta/status/1267635481317183488"">said</a>.</p><p>Graham wrote in the Inquirer that she was eventually able to maneuver her hands in order to send texts to her husband and editor on her smartwatch. A lawyer for the Inquirer contacted city officials. Around 9 p.m., the journalists were released without charge but with an apology from officials.</p><p>City spokesperson Mike Dunn told the Tracker that Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney is “extremely troubled” by the detentions and has called some of the journalists. Both Mayor Kenney and Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw “are strongly committed to allowing press access so the public can be fully informed,” Dunn said.</p><p>Toward that end, Dunn said Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw ordered an investigation into the detentions. And police protocols that ensure “properly credentialed press are essential workers and not subject to restrictions of a curfew, as long as they are not impeding public safety or police operations […] have been reiterated repeatedly in internal communications to officers.”</p><p>The U.S. Press Freedom Tracker is documenting several hundred total incidents of journalists assaulted, arrested, struck by crowd control ammunition or tear gas or had their equipment damaged while covering protests across the country related to the death of George Floyd.

Floyd was later pronounced dead at a hospital.</p><p>Bishop, who has produced work for The Daily Dot and Patch.com, was <a href=""https://twitter.com/sebishop99/status/1267882265318735875"">recording protests</a> on his Twitter page. He told the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker that the scene grew tense when police in riot gear began arresting protesters and dispersing the crowd using pepper spray and projectiles, interrupting what he described as a peaceful demonstration up until that point.</p><p>A Worcester Police Department <a href=""http://www.worcesterma.gov/police/press-releases/nineteen-arrested-on-main-st-after-police-pelted-with-rocks-roman-candles#id7zYsc_Ax7k_lfV_9XVPvxw"">press release</a> says that officers began to use “less-lethal measures including smoke grenades and pepperball rounds” after people in the crowd targeted them.</p><p>As the protest thinned out, he said, police continued to shoot tear gas and projectiles and people threw tear gas canisters and rocks at the police. Bishop said he identified himself as a member of the press to a sergeant who assured him that he would not be attacked or targeted as long as he was not breaking the law.</p><p>“At this point, most of the crowd was about maybe 300 yards back from the riot squad officers when I went up to them,” Bishop told the Tracker.</p><p>Bishop stood away from the crowd to avoid projectiles when he said an officer, who was standing close to the sergeant he had spoken with, started shooting at him with projectiles. He believes the officer overheard him seeking assurances from his colleague, and was deliberately targeting him.</p><p>“As I&#x27;m going back, probably off to the side from the main street, I&#x27;m up on the sidewalk, it&#x27;s clear, I&#x27;m alone, there&#x27;s nobody else near me,” Bishop said. “And then suddenly, I can see in front of me, and I guess kind of behind me the pavement being chipped off from the roadway [from the force of the projectiles].”</p><p>“I&#x27;m close enough that he can clearly see who I am, and I can see who he is,” said Bishop, who said he was wearing press identification.</p><p>Bishop said he moved back into the crowd to avoid being singled out by the police again. Inside the crowd, he was exposed to tear gas, which later caused him to develop a skin rash.</p><p>“For a couple days after what happened my face was blistered off,” Bishop said. “I don&#x27;t know if it was tear gas burns or some kind of allergic reaction, but my forehead and the base of my nose was really just like red and kind of burned.”</p><p>The Tracker contacted the Worcester Police Department to ask about the incident and the projectiles used. In response, a representative clarified that the department does not use rubber bullets. The representative did not immediately respond to follow up questions about Bishop’s other claims, but directed the Tracker to its <a href=""http://www.worcesterma.gov/police/press-releases/nineteen-arrested-on-main-st-after-police-pelted-with-rocks-roman-candles#id7zYsc_Ax7k_lfV_9XVPvxw"">press release</a> detailing the department’s version of the night’s events.</p><p>The U.S. Press Freedom Tracker is documenting several hundred total incidents of journalists assaulted, arrested, struck by crowd control ammunition or tear gas or had their equipment damaged while covering protests across the country related to the death of George Floyd while in police custody. <a href=""https://pressfreedomtracker.us/george-floyd-protests/"">Find these cases here</a>.</p><p><i>In a response to request for additional comment, the Worcester Police Department guided the Tracker to its press release.

Floyd was pronounced dead at a local hospital. Protests against police brutality and in support of the Black Lives Matter movement have been held across the United States since the end of May.</p><p>June 1 marked the second night of downtown Dallas’ 7 p.m. curfew, from which journalists were expressly excluded.</p><p>At around 9 p.m., Ryan Michalesko, a staff photojournalist at the Dallas Morning News, was photographing a group of several hundred protesters who’d marched from the county courthouse to the <a href=""https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/santiago-calatrava-margaret-hunt-hill-bridge-article"">Margaret Hunt Hill Bridge</a>, an architectural landmark that spans the Trinity River and connects downtown and west Dallas.</p><p>A police line began to form across the bridge, Michalesko told the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker in an email. “Over their speakers they ordered the protesters to stop moving forward and turn around. At this point many of the protesters took a knee with their arms in the air,” he wrote. Police then deployed canisters of smoke into the crowd, followed by tear gas.</p><p>Police in gas masks and riot gear began advancing on protesters from both sides of the bridge, employing a <a href=""https://www.wsj.com/articles/what-is-kettling-the-police-technique-used-in-george-floyd-protests-11591721558"">technique</a> known as “kettling” to hem them into a small area. As protesters came to realize what was happening, Michalesko turned toward them, exposing his back to police, he told the Tracker. “I knew at that moment it was important I find a way to capture the fear in people’s eyes as they found themselves trapped,” Michalesko wrote.</p><p>As he took photos, he regularly looked back over his shoulder at police. “This is when I was struck with a less-lethal round in the back of my upper thigh. I felt it hit, realized what had happened as I watched the blue-tipped projectile bounce across the ground,” he continued.</p><p>Michalesko was wearing press credentials, holding a camera and had another camera around his neck. But the shot came from 25 feet away, he estimated, putting him too far from police to be identifiable as press. He was unable to identify to which agency the officer who fired the shot belonged.</p><p>Police then began to command everyone on the bridge to lie down on their stomachs, before firing foam rounds and other projectiles. “I could tell they were aiming these at the ground near people’s feet,” he wrote. Michalesko complied with police commands and continued to snap photos of the moving line from his stomach. “I also felt like the officers were at this point still too far away for me to face them and attempt to declare myself as press. I had already been hit once and didn’t want it to happen again,” he wrote.</p><p>When he saw an officer nearby, he shouted, “I am a photojournalist with the Dallas Morning News. Don’t shoot!” He then asked if he could stand up and continue to take photographs. According to Michalesko’s recounting, the officer said yes, before adding the caveat, “But if I tell you to move, you need to move quick.”</p><p>Michalesko continued to work, filming and photographing the scene as police zip-tied protesters’ hands and lined them up. He observed members of the Dallas Police Department, state troopers from the Texas Department of Public Safety, National Guardsmen and FBI agents as protesters were being detained and processed.</p></div></div>

The evening of June 1 was the second that downtown Dallas was under a 7 p.m. curfew, from which members of the media were explicitly exempt.</p><p>On the bridge, police employed a <a href=""https://www.wsj.com/articles/what-is-kettling-the-police-technique-used-in-george-floyd-protests-11591721558"">technique</a> known as “kettling” to hem in demonstrators from both sides. Monacelli was standing between the crowd and a police line, hugging one side of the bridge, when police began advancing towards the crowd, he said. One of the officers fired a wooden pellet, he said, which hit someone nearby before falling to the ground near Monacelli’s feet.</p><p>Seconds later, Monacelli was hit by a projectile. “I just got hit in the leg,” he exclaims on a video recording of the incident, which he <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/tv/CA6lRtthbgh/?igshid=eqfrzasewet9"">posted</a> to Instagram. A second projectile then struck his backpack and lower back. “They shot me twice, I’ve been shot twice with wooden pellets.”</p><p>Monacelli was wearing PRESS badges on his front and back, but said he didn’t have the opportunity to verbally identify himself as a member of the media before police fired on the crowd. He said it was dark on the bridge and very loud.</p><p>Monacelli told the Tracker while he initially suspected the projectiles that hit him were made of wood, he now believes the object that hit the back of his left thigh was a canister of tear gas, because of the sound it made on the video and the size of his resulting bruise. “In various videos of the moment at which I was shot you can hear a loud ‘POP’ and then metal sounding ricochet,” he <a href=""https://twitter.com/stevanzetti/status/1271290219669544960"">tweeted</a> days later.</p><p>The second projectile he believes was a green marking round, he said. Another freelance journalist on the bridge, Benjamin Diez, captured a <a href=""https://twitter.com/benjamindiez_/status/1268024795452641281"">video</a> of Monacelli being hit, showing the round that hit Monacelli’s back and backpack gave off a puff of green dust on impact.</p><p>Around ten minutes later, Monacelli was then detained with a group of protesters, despite his repeated declarations that he was a member of the media, he said. The officers demanded to see Monacelli’s laminated press credentials, which he didn’t have, and ignored his repeated invitations to view his LinkedIn profile on his phone, as well as his email exchanges with his editors.</p><p>“I&#x27;m reporting for the Dallas Voice, I&#x27;ve got the email from the editor. I&#x27;m a freelance journalist, so I can show you all the information...the magazine I&#x27;m with,” he told the police, in a video he <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/CA6qYUjhqhu/"">posted</a> to Instagram. He said he had emailed his editor, who he hoped would call the police. “Not sure what else I could do to show you who I am.”</p><p>“What sort of credentials, when you ask me that, are you looking for?” Monacelli asked the officer standing before him. The officer replied that he wanted to see a press ID on a lanyard. &quot;I&#x27;m stuck here because I don&#x27;t have a laminated card,&quot; Monacelli then tells the viewers of his Instagram livestream.</p><p>After detaining him over an hour, an officer placed him in zip ties at around 10:40 p.m. and told him he was under arrest. “Are you aware that I am a member of the press?” he said he asked the officer. In response, the officer replied, “you are under arrest,” Monacelli said.</p><p>After midnight, an officer took him up on his invitation to look at his email messages with his editor and his LinkedIn page. Satisfied he was a journalist, the officer released Monacelli from the zip ties. He was released without charges.</p><p>Later that morning, he snapped a photo of the newly formed bruise on the back of his leg, and <a href=""https://twitter.com/stevanzetti/status/1271274218748067842/photo/2"">posted</a> it to Twitter on June 11. Monacelli documented his experience on the bridge in a <a href=""https://dallasvoice.com/the-ringing-in-my-ears/"">story</a> in the Dallas Voice and in a <a href=""https://www.centraltrack.com/the-first-four-days-on-dpd-toys-early-protest-response/"">piece</a> for Central Track, a website covering Dallas culture.</p><p>Ryan Michalesko, a staff photographer at the Dallas Morning News, was hit in the thigh with a foam round while covering the same protest on the bridge.

Warren Mitchell, wrote, “We are not at a place we can speak on a specific incident during any nights of the protests.”</p><p>The protests were held in response to a video showing a white police officer kneeling on the neck of George Floyd, a Black man, during an arrest in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on May 25.

Taylor was shot eight times in her Louisville home in mid-March by narcotics police who broke down her door. Floyd died on May 25, after a white police officer in Minneapolis, Minnesota, kneeled on his neck for several minutes during an arrest. Video of Floyd’s death has sparked protests across the country.</p><p>Harris told the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker she had been photographing peaceful protests for several hours around Jefferson Square Park when police officers, who had previously been present only on the roofs of surrounding buildings, began to appear on the ground to enforce a 9 p.m. curfew. At approximately 10:15, Harris said, officers lined up in riot formation and announced that everyone present was in violation of curfew and ordered them to disperse.</p><p>The officers then began to shoot tear gas and pepper balls in all directions, according to Harris, and she was hit with a pepper ball. Both she and a nearby TV news crew, with whom she had paired up with earlier in the day for safety purposes, all felt the tear gas, she said. Harris said it was impossible to know whether they had been targeted.</p><p>Harris and the other journalists tried to flee but couldn’t tell which direction the projectiles were coming from and felt surrounded on all sides, she told the Tracker.

Spangle’s exploration of fashion in the protests was published in <a href=""https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/politics/article/george-floyd-protest-photos"">British GQ</a> and <a href=""https://www.achtung-mode.com/black-lives-matter/"">Achtung Digital</a>.</p><p>The protests were held in response to a video showing a white police officer kneeling on the neck of George Floyd, a Black man, during an arrest in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on May 25. Floyd was pronounced dead at a local hospital. Protests against police brutality and in support of the Black Lives Matter movement have been held across the U.S. since the end of May.</p><p>As part of the protests, hundreds of demonstrators marched down Sunset Boulevard on June 1, according to <a href=""https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-06-01/an-lapd-officer-takes-to-his-knee-to-cheers-of-hollywood-protesters"">news reports</a>. But after a 6 p.m. curfew, the majority of protesters began to disperse, Spangle said. He decided to head back toward his car.</p><p>Along the way, Spangle realized that law enforcement had begun to block streets, trapping protesters and Spangle on Schrader Boulevard near a parking lot just north of Sunset Boulevard. Fear and confusion took over the block, Spangle said.</p><p>“This is kettling and we’re getting locked in here,” Spangle recalled thinking. “The thing to do is go out and loudly identify yourself as press.”</p><p>Spangle, who was wearing a helmet with the word PRESS on it, stepped into the middle of the street with a badge identifying him as press in one hand and his camera in the other.</p><p>“At the top of my voice, I very loudly announced, ‘Hey I’m a journalist,’” Spangle said. “‘What do you want me to do, officer?’”</p><p>But he received no response. Six or seven times he said he tried to the same effect. So Spangle turned and approached another line of officers in the same way. Five or six times more he identified as a journalist, he said. But still, there was no response. Spangle was trapped.</p><p>Shortly before 9 p.m., two officers approached Spangle and ordered Spangle to get on his knees and put his hands on the back of his head, he told the Tracker. He was then zip-cuffed.</p><p>“I let them do their thing,” Spangle said. “I said, ‘Hey sir, please look at my press badge. I’m here as a journalist. I’m covering the event. I’m complying.’” He told the Tracker that he tried to draw on his military experience to respond in a calm, professional manner to resolve what he assumed was a mistake.</p><p>Officers brought Spangle to a fence where they were gathering others that had been arrested, he said. Spangle asked a journalist on the other side of the fence, which was outside the police cordon, to contact his editor at GQ about his arrest.</p><p>After about thirty minutes, Spangle said he was taken to a transport vehicle along with other people who had been arrested. Officers performed a search of Spangle’s possessions and confiscated a small camera bag. But they left his cameras, press badge, and phone with him, Spangle said.</p><p>Spangle said he never heard an officer acknowledge his repeated attempts to identify as a journalist. “I think there were efforts for those kinds of things to not be said out loud,” Spangle said.</p><p>As he got on the bus, he asked an officer to inform the supervisor he is a journalist, Spangle told the Tracker. The officer responded, “All I can say to you is you’ll be alright,” Spangle said. Spangle interpreted the answer as evidence that a bad command decision had been made to arrest everyone in the area, journalist or not.</p><p>The bus drove around the city for hours, stopping at two other locations, until stopping to process the arrestees shortly before midnight at the parking lot of UCLA’s Jackie Robinson Stadium, Spangle said. He was one of the last on the bus to be released on a charge of violating the Los Angeles County curfew.</p><p>The university later issued a <a href=""https://twitter.com/UCLA/status/1268039753015812096"">statement</a> saying it was &quot;troubled&quot; that the stadium was used as a processing center &quot;without UCLA&#x27;s knowledge or permission.”</p><p>Spangle said he was arrested by Los Angeles County Sheriff’s deputies, who wear a distinct tan and green uniform that contrasts the dark blue worn by officers with the Los Angeles Police Department. Spangle said he was transported in a sheriff’s bus. He received a citation from the LAPD at a processing center in western Los Angeles and said he received his seized camera bag back with the citation.</p><p>Spokespeople for the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department and LAPD told the Tracker that they could not provide specific information on Spangle’s arrest because of the sheer number of arrests made during the protests.</p><p>Footage from <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?v=257541868845433&amp;ref=watch_permalink"">news</a> <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrsBu80BCE4"">helicopters</a> that night shows LAPD officers, assisted by sheriff’s deputies, attempting to contain multiple marches and scattered looting across Hollywood.

He described it as, “press or whatever, it doesn’t matter, we’re arresting everyone.”</p><p>Rob Wilcox, a spokesperson for Feuer, told the Tracker that the office is in the process of sending thousands of declination letters to those arrested on curfew related charges. The letter says the office will use its prosecutorial discretion to not file criminal charges and invites the recipient to join a series of virtual conversations on law enforcement, bias, and injustice. Wilcox said 2,044 letters had been sent as of July 27 and the remainder will be sent by the end of the week.</p><p>Spangle said as of July 27 he had not yet received the letter.</p><p>The U.S. Press Freedom Tracker is documenting several hundred total incidents of journalists assaulted, arrested, struck by crowd control ammunition or tear gas or had their equipment damaged while covering Black Lives Matter protests across the country.

The three students clearly and repeatedly identified themselves as members of the media before the assault, according to interviews with the journalists and video footage of the incident.</p><p>The protests were held in response to a video showing a white police officer kneeling on the neck of George Floyd, a Black man, during an arrest in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on May 25. Floyd was pronounced dead at a local hospital. Protests against police violence and in support of the Black Lives Matter movement have been held across the U.S. since the end of May.</p><p>On the night of June 1, Lantern editors Sarah Szilagy, Max Garrison, and Maeve Walsh were covering peaceful protests that had moved from the Ohio Statehouse in downtown Columbus toward the Ohio State University campus. About 20 minutes after a 10 p.m. curfew went into effect, the protesters reached the intersection of North High Street and Lane Avenue on the edge of campus.</p><p>Up until this point, the journalists had not noticed a police presence. A few minutes after reaching the intersection, however, police cars suddenly arrived and stopped behind the protesters, Garrison and Walsh told the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker.</p><p>Police officers got out of their cars, walked swiftly through the crowd, and began using pepper spray to disperse the protesters, they said. The three journalists, who were standing behind a concrete barrier on the sidewalk, somewhat removed from the protesters in the street, remained on the scene as the protesters left, Garrison and Walsh told the Tracker. Szilagy, the Lantern’s campus editor, did not respond to emailed requests for comment.</p><p>The journalists were then “approached from multiple directions by police officers telling them to ‘go home’ because of the curfew,” according to an <a href=""https://www.thelantern.com/2020/06/lantern-journalists-targeted-by-police-pepper-sprayed/"">account</a> of the incident Garrison wrote for The Lantern.</p><p>“Our reporters continued to film and identify themselves as members of the news media, who are exempt from the curfew,” wrote Garrison, who is the assistant campus editor. “A group of police officers continued to yell over our reporters, saying they ‘don’t care’ and ‘get inside.’ The officers also threatened our reporters with arrest.”</p><p>Walsh, special projects editor, told the Tracker that all three journalists were holding their press passes in the air to show them to the officers and repeatedly identified themselves as press. In a video Walsh posted to Twitter, an officer tells her, “Leave or you’re going to jail.” When Walsh responds, “we’re members of the media,” the officer says, “I don’t care.”</p></div></div>

<div class=""block-rich_text""><div class=""rich-text""><p>In a press conference the following day, Columbus Police Chief Thomas Quinlan was asked about the police officers’ treatment of journalists.</p><p>“There’s no malice involved, there’s no intent, it’s just a very chaotic situation,” Quinlan <a href=""https://www.10tv.com/article/news/local/watch-mayor-ginther-chief-quinlan-hold-briefing-discuss-columbus-protests-2020-jun/530-d7f35334-ca71-40fb-9508-6ca49a458c8f"">said</a>. “And in that regard, I’d ask the public to have some patience and please comply, and we’ll work it out afterward. But please don’t stand there and argue; move along and comply and we’ll fix this after the fact so nothing bad happens.”</p><p>Quinlan also said, “we are dealing with imperfect human beings in imperfect situations. Mistakes will happen and we will take action to correct them and make sure that we do not allow our mistakes to be repeated.”</p><p>When asked specifically about the incident involving the Ohio State student journalists, Chief Quinlan said the reporters were not easily recognizable as news media, but the department had launched an internal affairs investigation of the officers, the <a href=""https://www.dispatch.com/news/20200602/columbus-police-to-investigate-officers-who-pepper-sprayed-ohio-state-student-journalists?rssfeed=true"">Dispatch reported</a>.</p><p>“We are aware of the incident in question and it is currently under investigation per our use of force policy,” Sergeant James Fuqua, public information officer, said in response to the Tracker’s request for a status update.</p><p>In a separate incident on the evening of June 1, two journalists with public radio station WOSU said they were threatened with pepper spray by a Columbus police officer.</p><p>Reporter Paige Southwick Pfleger and All Things Considered host Clare Roth were covering the protests in the downtown area when they saw reports on social media of the attack on the student journalists, Pfleger said. By the time the WOSU reporters arrived at the intersection of North High Street and Lane Avenue at around 10:45 p.m., Pfleger said most of the crowd had dispersed. Pfleger said she saw one individual on the ground being arrested and a group of more than a dozen police officers.</p><p>As the two journalists reached the intersection, Pfleger said several police officers approached them and told them to leave. Pfleger, who was holding her WOSU media badge in her hand to show the officers, replied that they had a right to be there as members of the media.</p><p>According to Pfleger, the officer told them, “You have to go one block down. If I have to tell you again I&#x27;m going to hose you.” A different officer, who was about a foot away from the journalists, then raised a can of pepper spray at their eye level and told them to leave immediately, Pfleger said. As the women walked away from the scene, the officer followed them for half a block and continued to threaten them with the pepper spray, Pfleger said.</p><p>In a video Pfleger posted to Twitter, an officer is shown following them with the pepper spray canister raised in his hand. Pfleger is heard saying, “I’m sorry what was that threat? We’re members of the media, you have no right, and we’re walking away.” The officer then turned around and left.</p></div></div>

<div class=""block-rich_text""><div class=""rich-text""><p>After the incident, Burness ran into Hernandez, the Denverite and Colorado Public Radio reporter, near the state capitol building. The lights around the capitol were off, creating an “uneasy” atmosphere, Burness said. A large crowd of protesters had amassed on the north side of the building. Police moved toward protesters, firing tear gas. Burness and Hernandez decided to leave the area, heading away from the tear gas toward the capitol’s south side.</p><p>There, they encountered a line of officers standing across a two-lane street. Burness saw an opening that would have allowed them to leave the area without crossing the police line. “We shouted to them ‘Press!’ several times,” Burness said. Both had press credentials around their necks and Hernandez wore a neon yellow vest with ‘PRESS’ written on it in large letters. “One of the officers points that we have to head the other way, back towards where the tear gas is coming from.” Burness and Hernandez continued to shout “Press! Press! Press!” to get the officers to allow them to pass through the open area. But police refused. In a show of force, one lifted what Burness described as a rifle used to shoot less-lethal projectiles, and pointed it directly at the journalists.</p><p>“There is no doubt in my mind that those officers knew we were press. We were 40 feet away from the guy, we’re shouting press, he’s looking directly at us, he knows what’s up, he still did that,” Burness said, calling the incident “a flagrant disregard for our press rights.”</p><p>The two retreated back towards the capitol lawn, where they were engulfed in a cloud of tear gas. Burness, wearing ski goggles and an N95 mask, said he couldn’t see at more than five percent for several minutes. “It was very intense, extremely unpleasant, and crucially, totally unnecessary,” he said. Both <a href=""https://twitter.com/alex_burness/status/1267319325846917120"">Burness</a> and <a href=""https://twitter.com/EstebanHRZ/status/1267318923243986945"">Hernandez</a> tweeted about the incident. Reached via direct message on Twitter, Hernandez declined to comment.</p><p>Multiple law enforcement agencies were operating in the area at the time, Burness said, including the Colorado Army National Guard, Denver Police, the Colorado State Patrol, and sheriffs’ departments from various counties across the state. Burness said he believes the officer who trained his gun at them was with the Colorado State Patrol.</p><p>The Tracker reached out to the Colorado State Patrol, which refused to comment on the incidents, saying they involved the Denver Police Department. A request for comment to the Denver Police Department was not immediately returned.</p><p>Burness said while he has lingering bruises from being hit, “I’m much more shaken up by how our rights were disregarded.”</p><p>“Even though there certainly has been much more interest on Twitter and from people who care about me about me being shot at with these foam bullets, the other incident to me, from a press freedom perspective, is significantly more troubling,” Burness said, referring to the officer who pointed the less-lethal rifle at the reporters.</p><p>The U.S. Press Freedom Tracker is documenting several hundred total incidents of journalists assaulted, arrested, struck by crowd control ammunition or tear gas or had their equipment damaged while covering protests across the country related to the death of George Floyd while in police custody.

Floyd was later pronounced dead at a hospital. Thousands gathered around the convenience store where Floyd had been detained and at the police department’s Third Precinct building in the days that followed.</p><p>Moya-Smith told the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker that he was following along with a group of about a dozen Native American and black protesters as they walked through the south side of Minneapolis shortly after 1 a.m. An 8 p.m. curfew order was in place that night, though members of the media were <a href=""http://news.minneapolismn.gov/2020/05/30/frequently-asked-questions-about-the-curfew-in-minneapolis/"">explicitly exempt</a>.</p><p>Four or five Minneapolis police cruisers suddenly came upon the group and encircled them, Moya-Smith said. An officer in one of the vehicles shouted, “Go home! Go home!” to which one of the protesters responded, “We are! We are going home!”</p><p>An officer then jumped out of one of the cruisers and began pepper-spraying the protesters indiscriminately and ordering them to get on the ground.</p><p>“As we’re all lying down, she comes around and just begins to spray as if she were in her backyard garden — individually, as if she were just spraying her plants,” Moya-Smith said.</p><p>He added that he, too, was sprayed while facedown, much of it hitting his back.</p><p>“It was a completely unnecessary use of force on the group. Everyone was complying,” Moya-Smith said.</p><p>Officers then came around to each of the protesters and asked for their IDs. When they came around to Moya-Smith, he told them that he had an ID in his wallet and that he was a reporter with NBC News. When they told him to wait as he was, Moya-Smith said he thought, “OK, so this is how this is going to go.”</p><p>“I’m sure one, two or maybe all of them knew that if they allowed me to exercise my First Amendment right as a reporter that I would immediately begin documenting the situation, and I think that is what they were trying to prevent,” Moya-Smith said.</p><p>Moya-Smith told the Tracker that multiple officers checked his press badge: One referred to him as “Mr. Journalist” when ordering him to roll over; another simply shrugged.</p></div></div>

Floyd was later pronounced dead in a hospital.</p><p>The officer has been charged with second-degree murder. Three other officers who were present face felony charges.</p><p>Castañeda told the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker that the May 31 protest began at San Francisco City Hall. It was the first day of a citywide 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew that was lifted less than a week later.</p><p>Castañeda was following the main body of the protest group that remained after 8 p.m. as it continued to splinter off after encounters with law enforcement. Around 10 p.m. the protesters went down an alleyway called Stevenson Street, which connects 6th and 7th streets in San Francisco’s Mid-Market neighborhood.</p><p>The San Francisco Police Department “was able to kettle them in and block off both entrances to the alleyway,” Castañeda told the Tracker. “And they immediately started clearing everyone that was inside that alley, which was by that point maybe 30 protesters just because the main group had been whittled down so much at that point.”</p><p>Castañeda identified himself as press and was put against the wall alongside the protesters. He said that his press pass was displayed on a lanyard over his jacket. San Francisco police officers searched his pockets and his backpack, but not his notebook or phone, Castañeda said. Then, officers instructed him to sit on the curb with the other protesters. His hands were zip tied behind his back by police officers.</p><p>“The police captain in charge of the operation that night came by and said, ‘I can see you’re press. We’re going to detain you but we’re not going to take you to the county jailhouse for processing,’” Castañeda said.</p><p>Castañeda captured audio from his detainment by recording a video from his cell phone, which was inside his jacket pocket.

State police officers stood in a line on the highway, where, two hours earlier, a truck had plowed into a crowd of protesters.</p><p>As Simons began his live shot, several members of the Minnesota State Patrol, clad in tan riot gear, bounded up the hillside towards the journalists. “Hey, we’re press, guys, from D.C.,” Simons shouted. “We’re all press here.” Despite this, at least one officer in riot gear pointed his gun at him through the fence.</p><p>&quot;Come on guys we have permission to be out here! Stop it!” Simons continued, as the officer continued to train his weapon at him. “Sir, the governor of Minnesota exempts press,” he said, referencing the curfew.</p><p>Simons and Förg cut their live shot short, got into their car, and drove away.

Other members of the media were present in the vicinity, Simons said, but he did not know their names or outlets.</p><p>State police had already cleared protesters off the highway when they turned their attention to the press, Simons said.</p><p>When Simons and Förg drove away, the officers fired some sort of projectile at their vehicle, which pinged the door but did not damage it, Simons said.</p><p>A day prior, on May 30, police <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NN8ISwuiX68"">fired projectiles</a> at Simons and his crew and threatened them with arrest.

Around 9 p.m., police fired tear gas to disperse the crowd, according to <a href=""https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2020/05/31/detroit-protests-police-curfew-sunday/5301174002/?utm_campaign=snd-autopilot"">news reports</a>.</p><p>About thirty minutes later, MacDonald saw a couple people running in Grand Circus Park near Woodward Avenue, she said. A police officer tackled one of them to the ground. MacDonald filmed the apparent arrest by <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/DetroitNews/videos/855231228320197"">livestreaming</a> from her phone. She filmed from a distance to not interfere.</p><p>Suddenly without warning, the livestream picks up the sound of ratcheting handcuffs from behind. A voice asks, “Who are you with?” MacDonald was being detained.</p><p>“It happened very quickly. There was no conversation,” MacDonald said. “As soon as I noticed someone behind me is when I felt my hands being brought to the back.”</p><p>She told the Tracker she tried to follow a colleague’s advice on what to do if detained: check your ego, identify yourself, and try to sort it out.</p><p>MacDonald identified herself as a journalist and said she had her press credentials around her neck.</p><p>“I had that gas mask on but I could still talk,” MacDonald said. “It wasn’t like he couldn’t hear me. He could hear me through that mask.”</p><p>The officer escorted MacDonald to his patrol car on Woodward Avenue and told her to stand at the front of the vehicle, MacDonald said.</p><p>MacDonald’s livestream, obscured by her handcuffed hands reflecting the blue and red of police lights, continued to broadcast as the officer checked her credentials.</p><p>On the way out of the park, the officer asked someone else who had a camera if MacDonald was with him, she told the Tracker. The person said no.</p><p>Eli Newman, a reporter and producer for NPR-affiliate WDET, told the Tracker he was walking with a group of about a half-dozen journalists for safety when he saw a woman in a gas mask walking handcuffed to a police vehicle.</p><p>The group was not immediately sure if she was a journalist or not, Newman said. But Newman thought he recognized MacDonald. So he shouted to confirm and she nodded her head. Realizing she was a colleague, the journalists tried to vouch for her with the police officer.</p><p>A <a href=""https://twitter.com/MKurlyandchik/status/1267269219789529090"">video</a> filmed by Detroit Free Press journalist Mark Kurlyandchik shows the police officer examining MacDonald’s credentials hanging around her neck. Someone off camera says “We all know her!”</p><p>Newman said he believed the journalists’ intervention helped ensure her release. MacDonald said the officer did not acknowledge the journalists, but they were vocal and he was likely aware that they were filming the interaction.</p><p>The officer asked MacDonald twice if she planned to go home after her release due to curfew, she told the Tracker. MacDonald said she would continue reporting as she was exempt from the curfew.</p><p>The officer told MacDonald that he believed her and joked about helping the police out next time by tripping people running away after throwing bottles at them, MacDonald told the Tracker.</p><p>The officer released MacDonald less than three minutes after he detained her.</p><p>It is not clear why the officer immediately handcuffed MacDonald before interacting with her. MacDonald told the Tracker that she had identified herself as a journalist to police prior to the incident.</p><p>“There was no reason to detain me,” MacDonald said. “Earlier in the night, officers asked me who I was and when I responded who I was, they had no problem leaving me to my job, but this officer didn’t even have a conversation with me before putting the cuffs on.”</p><p>MacDonald said she did not ask the officer to identify himself, and the Detroit police did not respond to a request for comment about the detainment.</p><p>Speaking about MacDonald and other incidents involving journalists that night, Sgt. Nicole Kirkwood, also a department spokesperson, told <a href=""https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/detroit-city/2020/05/31/detroit-news-reporter-detained-other-journalists-say-they-were-shoved-detroit-officers-during-protes/5304445002/"">Detroit News</a>, “we take every allegation seriously” and “the vast majority of the men and women in the department do get it right.”</p><p>After May 31, the Detroit police began issuing daily, color-coded press passes to journalists to facilitate the identification of journalists in protests, MacDonald and Newman told the Tracker.</p><p>MacDonald debriefed with the other journalists following her encounter with police. “My editor is yelling at me because my hand was in front of the camera,” she said in her still-broadcasting livestream. “Well yeah, because I was arrested.”</p><p>The U.S. Press Freedom Tracker is documenting several hundred incidents of journalists assaulted, arrested, struck by crowd control ammunition or tear gas or had their equipment damaged while covering protests across the country.

Baylon is a columnist for East County Californian and his campus newspaper The SWC Sun, but was covering the protest as an independent reporter.</p><p>The protest was part of a wave of Black Lives Matter and anti-police brutality demonstrations across the country sparked by the release of a video showing a white Minneapolis police officer kneeling on the neck of George Floyd, a Black man, during an arrest. Floyd was later pronounced dead in a hospital. The officer has been charged with second-degree murder. Three other officers who were present face felony charges.</p><p>The protesters were standing in front of Spreckels Theatre at 121 Broadway in downtown San Diego facing a line of San Diego Police Department officers, Baylon told the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker. At 3:19 p.m. the SDPD <a href=""https://twitter.com/SanDiegoPD/status/1267219071168155649"">tweeted</a>, “Unlawful assembly order being given in the area of Broadway. We are asking everyone to disperse immediately due to the escalation of violence by the protestors.”</p><p>Baylon was standing on a ramp in front of a business near the police line. “At one point the officers started putting on their gas masks and then the crowd started saying to themselves ‘hey, watch out, they’re getting ready.’ A lot of people didn’t know, but those that got the word started moving back,” he said.</p><p>At 3:10 p.m. Baylon recorded a video that appears to show SDPD firing pepper balls and flashbangs at the protesters. In the recording Baylon says, “We’re all coughing, it’s everywhere.”</p><p>At 3:41 p.m. Baylon <a href=""https://twitter.com/plutotoplato/status/1267224695239131137"">tweeted</a> a video that he began recording at 3:19 p.m. Tear gas appears to blow back toward where Baylon is standing. He ducks behind a railing and moves away from the street, eventually taking shelter among overturned patio tables and pouring milk in his eyes. A badge identifying him as press is visible on a lanyard around his neck. “As we’re crawling to get out, we’re still shot,” Baylon said of the video. “I’m nowhere near where the protesters were.”</p><p>The camera bag that Baylon was wearing prevented the pepper balls from physically harming him, he told the Tracker. A photograph shows residue from the pepper balls on Baylon’s bag.</p><p>The video lasts one minute and forty-eight seconds, Baylon estimates he was in the line of fire for forty seconds of that. The SDPD repeated the same crowd-clearing tactics throughout the afternoon. SDPD didn’t respond to a request for comment.</p><p>The U.S. Press Freedom Tracker is documenting several hundred incidents of journalists assaulted, arrested, struck by crowd control ammunition or tear gas or had their equipment damaged while covering protests across the country related to the death of George Floyd while in police custody.

Floyd was pronounced dead at a local hospital. Protests against police brutality and in support of the Black Lives Matter movement have been held across the U.S. since the end of May.</p><p>On the night of May 31, Cairns and his colleague Dean Narciso left the Dispatch office and walked half a block to the intersection of Broad and High streets adjacent to the Ohio state capitol building where protesters had gathered. At around 9:45 p.m., shortly before a 10 p.m. curfew went into effect, Cairns observed a large police presence moving into formation in the middle of the intersection, he told the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker. As the officers lined up, he said he saw something that resembled a water bottle thrown at the police. Immediately, and without warning, according to Cairns, police began shooting projectiles and pepper spray to disperse the crowd.</p><p>Cairns and Narciso were standing at a distance from the group of protesters who had congregated. They turned to leave the scene. At that moment, Cairns told the Tracker, he was struck on the back of his right ear and cheek by what appeared to be a wooden bullet, knocking his safety glasses off his head. Narciso was not hit, according to Cairns. The men returned to the Dispatch office and Cairns said he did not resume photographing the protests until the following night. The projectile left a welt on his cheek for several hours and a scratch on his ear, he said. His equipment was not damaged.</p><p>In a photograph taken by Cairns shortly before he turned away and was hit, a police officer can be seen aiming in his direction.</p></div></div>

He said an officer in front of him “spun me around and hit me with a baton in my posterior hard enough to drop me to the ground.” Rodier said he yelled, “I’m a journalist,” again and that the officer responded, “I don’t care.

Floyd was pronounced dead at a local hospital. Protests against police violence and in support of the Black Lives Matter movement have been held across the U.S. since the end of May.</p><p>Blint-Welsh told the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker that on the evening of May 31 he was walking his bike through a crowd a couple of blocks from Union Square, his New York Police Department-issued press credentials dangling from his neck. He saw police officers in riot gear and with Plexiglas shields a couple rows deep. Protesters faced down the police and refused to leave, he said.</p><p>Blint-Welsh said that NYPD played a recording over and over, for about 15 to 20 minutes: “This protest is destructive and violent. We order you to disperse. If you do not disperse, you are subject to arrest.”</p><p>In response, the crowd began to chant, “This is a nonviolent protest!”</p><p>Suddenly, Blint-Welsh said, the police rushed forward. People screamed and started to run, he said, but he decided it was better if he stayed apart, on a street corner. He left his bike and found himself in a group of people under some scaffolding.</p><p>Blint-Welsh said he told an officer, “I’m press!” and raised his hands in the air.</p><p>Then, he said, an officer pushed his shield into the journalist’s face, hard, with a corner of the shield tearing his lip and breaking his glasses, which fell from his face. Blint-Welsh said his head was protected by his bike helmet.</p><p>The reporter said it felt dangerous to turn and walk away, but when the sidewalk widened, he was able to do so. Blint-Welsh said that’s when a police officer shoved him in the back and he fell, injuring his ankle.</p><p>He said he heard an officer yell, “Get ’em!” as if officers were going to jump on him.</p><p>At about 11 p.m., Blint-Welsh posted about the assault on Twitter.</p></div></div>

The Nine News crew documented protesters <a href=""https://twitter.com/TimArvier9/status/1266910436215132169"">marching</a> in defiance of an 8 p.m. curfew as the <a href=""https://twitter.com/9NewsAUS/status/1267062595778949120"">police pushed</a> back with less-lethal projectiles and tear gas.</p><p>The crew was driving to find a backdrop for a live interview when they heard gunfire and encountered a police roadblock, Arvier told the Tracker.</p><p>“We didn’t want to approach the roadblock, or drive up to it because obviously we’d seen numerous examples in the past 48 hours of how jumpy the police were,” Arvier said.</p><p>So Bovino stopped the car short of the roadblock and waited for the police to notice them, Arvier told the Tracker. As the police officers approached, the crew held their hands out the windows and shouted that they were press.</p><p>Two officers seemed calm, Arvier said, but a third yelled at them to get out of the car and drew his firearm.</p><p>“That’s when I hit record on my phone and held my phone up in my hand to record all this happening, just to have a record,” Arvier said. The crew tried to remain calm to avoid misunderstandings that could have escalated, he told the Tracker.</p><p>The security guard, who the crew hired after observing street violence, informed the police that he had weapons in the car, Arvier said.</p><p>In Arvier’s <a href=""https://twitter.com/9NewsAUS/status/1267062595778949120"">video</a>, a police officer warns other officers to not let the journalists and the security guard drop their hands because there are guns in the car.</p><p>Arvier asks an officer in the video if it is okay to keep holding his phone in his raised hands. The officer responds, “You’re good.”</p><p>The officer who drew his weapon searched Bovino and escorted him handcuffed to the curb, Arvier said. The security guard was brought by another officer to the curb handcuffed as well.</p><p>A third officer searched Arvier, who continued to film. Additional <a href=""https://www.9news.com.au/national/usa-riots-minneapolis-george-floyd-black-man-death-police/ada0a989-1201-44a2-b9e9-ff2d4a04cb39?ocid=Social-9News"">footage</a> shows Arvier holding his credentials in one hand as he’s searched. As he is patted down, Arvier explains to the officer that he is wearing a bulletproof vest.</p><p>In the video, an officer explains why the Nine News Australia crew was being treated carefully. “You can hear all the gunshots going off all around us. It’s like a warzone,” the officer said. “And here you guys are in bulletproof vests with a rifle in the car.”</p><p>Arvier was escorted to the curb, but he was not handcuffed like his colleagues. After the police checked their press credentials, the crew was released. Arvier said the crew was carrying press passes issued by the Los Angeles Police Department since their bureau is based in Los Angeles.</p><p>The police warned the journalists that it was dangerous to be out and advised them to return to their hotel for their safety, Arvier said.</p><p>Arvier said they had been treated respectfully and he understood why the police would be anxious. But it was unclear why they had to be detained and handcuffed. They had previously been pulled over to have their credentials checked without issue, Arvier said.</p><p>“If it wasn’t for the one police officer there, I get the feeling that the other ones would’ve handled it a lot more calmly and we probably would have been fine like we were the first time we were pulled over,” Arvier said.</p><p>Minnesota Police Department spokesperson John Elder told the Tracker he was unable to comment about this and other incidents involving the press. He said, “Every use of force by the MPD is under investigation internally.”</p><p>The crew’s detention on May 30 was one of several incidents involving the police during the days of protests, Arvier told the Tracker. On the night of May 29 the crew was pinned down in a parking lot in the 5th Precinct as police confronted protesters with tear gas and rubber bullets, Arvier said. They were trying to return to their car to send footage back to Australia, but the police line blocked their way. When the crew tried to approach the line while identifying as press, the police yelled at them to get back. Police eventually escorted Bovino to the team’s vehicle to retrieve the equipment they needed. The vehicle had a large dent that the journalists presumed came from a tear gas canister strike.</p><p>On May 31, the crew was filming <a href=""https://twitter.com/9NewsSyd/status/1267431786893717504"">police push back protesters</a> near a highway, Arvier said. The crew positioned off to the side so that they could either fall back on the highway or behind police lines to stay safe, Arvier said. But Nine News footage shows Arvier and his cameraman forced by police to run through tear gas. &quot;That is ugly, ugly scenes,&quot; Arvier said in a <a href=""https://twitter.com/TimArvier9/status/1267254264679694336"">video posted to Twitter</a> as he struggled with the effects of the tear gas.</p><p>Arvier told the Tracker he recognized the risks the police were facing and did not feel bitter toward them. But he noted their attitude toward journalists seemed different than in previous protests he has covered.</p><p>In other protests, “the cops just sort of let you work through it and we don’t get in their way and they don’t get in our way and everyone is fine,” Arvier said “But that certainly seemed to be a different state of affairs in terms of the police attitude in Minneapolis.”</p><p>The U.S. Press Freedom Tracker is documenting several hundred incidents of journalists assaulted, arrested, struck by crowd control ammunition or tear gas or had their equipment damaged while covering protests across the country.

Murtaugh said that some protesters had set debris on fire in the middle of the road and, in response, a line of officers in riot gear from the U.S. Park Police had advanced, clearing the street and securing the area. In a video Murtaugh shared with the Tracker, a woman can be seen approaching the officers and attempting to talk with them. An officer can be seen shoving her back with their shield, to which she responded by yelling, “We aren’t doing shit to you!” In the video, some objects, including what appear to be firecrackers, are tossed at officers.</p><p>While he was filming this altercation, Murtaugh said an officer rushed toward him and slammed their shield into him. Murtaugh said that he was clearly identifiable as a member of the media — his credentials were visible, and he was holding a large camera with a light atop it.

Cameraman Adam Bovino and U.S. Correspondent Tim Arvier were covering the fifth night of protests in Minneapolis, Minnesota.</p><p>The protests were held in response to a video showing a white police officer kneeling on the neck of George Floyd, a Black man, during an arrest in Minneapolis on May 25.

The Nine News crew documented protesters <a href=""https://twitter.com/TimArvier9/status/1266910436215132169"">marching</a> in defiance of an 8 p.m. curfew as the <a href=""https://twitter.com/9NewsAUS/status/1267062595778949120"">police pushed</a> back with less-lethal projectiles and tear gas.</p><p>The crew was driving to find a backdrop for a live interview when they heard gunfire and encountered a police roadblock, Arvier told the Tracker.</p><p>“We didn’t want to approach the roadblock, or drive up to it because obviously we’d seen numerous examples in the past 48 hours of how jumpy the police were,” Arvier said.</p><p>So Bovino stopped the car short of the roadblock and waited for the police to notice them, Arvier told the Tracker. As the police officers approached, the crew held their hands out the windows and shouted that they were press.</p><p>Two officers seemed calm, Arvier said, but a third yelled at them to get out of the car and drew his firearm.</p><p>“That’s when I hit record on my phone and held my phone up in my hand to record all this happening, just to have a record,” Arvier said. The crew tried to remain calm to avoid misunderstandings that could have escalated, he told the Tracker.</p><p>The security guard, who the crew hired after observing street violence, informed the police that he had weapons in the car, Arvier said.</p><p>In Arvier’s <a href=""https://twitter.com/9NewsAUS/status/1267062595778949120"">video</a>, a police officer warns other officers to not let the journalists and the security guard drop their hands because there are guns in the car.</p><p>Arvier asks an officer in the video if it is okay to keep holding his phone in his raised hands. The officer responds, “You’re good.”</p><p>Bovino, who declined an interview because Arvier had already spoken with the Tracker, said in an email that the officer who drew a firearm handcuffed him. Officers escorted Bovino and the security guard in handcuffs to the curb.</p><p>A third officer searched Arvier, who continued to film. Additional <a href=""https://www.9news.com.au/national/usa-riots-minneapolis-george-floyd-black-man-death-police/ada0a989-1201-44a2-b9e9-ff2d4a04cb39?ocid=Social-9News"">footage</a> shows Arvier holding his credentials in one hand as he’s searched. As he is patted down, Arvier explains to the officer that he is wearing a bulletproof vest.</p><p>In the video, an officer explains why the Nine News Australia crew was being treated carefully. “You can hear all the gunshots going off all around us. It’s like a warzone,” the officer said. “And here you guys are in bulletproof vests with a rifle in the car.”</p><p>Arvier was escorted to the curb, but he was not handcuffed like his colleagues. After the police checked their press credentials, the crew was released. Arvier said the crew was carrying press passes issued by the Los Angeles Police Department since their bureau is based in Los Angeles.</p><p>The police warned the journalists that it was dangerous to be out and advised them to return to their hotel for their safety, Arvier said.</p><p>Arvier said they had been treated respectfully and he understood why the police would be anxious. But it was unclear why they had to be detained and handcuffed. They had previously been pulled over to have their credentials checked without issue, Arvier said.</p><p>“If it wasn’t for the one police officer there, I get the feeling that the other ones would’ve handled it a lot more calmly and we probably would have been fine like we were the first time we were pulled over,” Arvier said.</p><p>Minnesota Police Department spokesperson John Elder told the Tracker he was unable to comment about this and other incidents involving the press. He said, “Every use of force by the MPD is under investigation internally.”</p><p>The crew’s detention on May 30 was one of several incidents involving the police during the days of protests, Arvier told the Tracker. On the night of May 29 the crew was pinned down in a parking lot in the 5th Precinct as police confronted protesters with tear gas and rubber bullets, Arvier said. They were trying to return to their car to send footage back to Australia, but the police line blocked their way. When the crew tried to approach the line while identifying as press, the police yelled at them to get back. Police eventually escorted Bovino to the team’s vehicle to retrieve the equipment they needed. The vehicle had a large dent that the journalists presumed came from a tear gas canister strike.</p><p>On May 31, the crew was filming <a href=""https://twitter.com/9NewsSyd/status/1267431786893717504"">police push back protesters</a> near a highway, Arvier said. The crew positioned off to the side so that they could either fall back on the highway or behind police lines to stay safe, Arvier said. But Nine News footage shows Arvier and Bovino forced by police to run through tear gas. &quot;That is ugly, ugly scenes,&quot; Arvier said in a <a href=""https://twitter.com/TimArvier9/status/1267254264679694336"">video posted to Twitter</a> as he struggled with the effects of the tear gas.</p></div></div>

While walking on East Marshall they encountered a line of police officers who were blocking the street and not allowing anyone to advance, Roldan said.</p><p>Seeking to leave the area, Roldan, who was wearing a reflective vest and his press badge around his neck, approached the line of police officers with his press badge in his hand and verbally identified himself as a member of the press, he told the Tracker.</p><p>”As soon as I said ‘I’m with the press,’ an officer on the police line who had a tank of pepper spray in his hand released the pepper spray at us,” Roldan said.

The canister happened to land near her, she said, and she inhaled the gas, which left her sweating and temporarily unable to see. “I just stumbled up a hill and thought I was going to throw up,” she said.

A few minutes in, she noted the use of what she described as pepper balls. A little over seven minutes into the video, an officer can be seen approaching Brookbank and other reporters in the area: “Go. Move. Now. What’d I tell you about curfew?” Brookbank and fellow Enquirer reporter Dan Horn can be heard identifying themselves as media and members of the press. The officer then says to Brookbank, “You don’t look like the media to me.” About an hour later, as she was documenting the arrest of a protester nearby, Brookbank <a href=""https://twitter.com/SarahBrookbank/status/1267278438924259328"">tweeted</a>: “Cops yelled at us as we filmed, told us to ‘get the f***k out of here’ and came toward us, I yelled that we were with the media, we’re told we needed ‘more visible’ marking.

<div class=""block-rich_text""><div class=""rich-text""><p><b>In Wilmington, North Carolina</b></p><ul><li>Reporter <b>Emily Featherston</b>, of WECT, an NBC affiliate station based in Wilmington, reported to the Tracker: “Myself and fellow reporter/videographer <b>Bryant Reed</b> were, like others, affected by tear gas (authorities originally denied having used CS tear gas, but when confronted with what we experienced and a canister found on the street, walked back). Then, after being told by the chief of police we were standing in an acceptable location (on the steps of City Hall, out of the street and way of law enforcement), a Sheriff&#x27;s deputy approached us in full riot gear.” Featherston said that the deputy then told them to move, to which they responded: “We’re with the media!” The deputy then said, “I don’t give a shit! Move!” according to Featherston. She continued: “The deputy then told us if we did not move we would be arrested on the spot. In the interest of continuing our coverage, we moved up the street.” In a <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/110795228128/videos/1456387391204324"">Facebook Live stream</a>, Featherston discussed the incident with New Hanover County Sheriff Ed McMahon, who apologized to her. Reed later <a href=""https://www.wect.com/2020/07/17/reporters-covering-protests-tear-gas-rocks-emotions-with-jon-evans-podcast/"">told WECT colleague Jon Evans</a> in his podcast 1on1 with Jon Evans: “We didn’t take a direct hit. Where we were, it was the wind that blew back the tear gas toward the officers we were close to. That’s how it got in our eyes, how we got affected. Then, one of the officers was telling us to disperse the area immediately or we could be arrested, so we had to walk back into the tear gas and we got more of it. At least for myself, it wasn’t that bad at first. But then within a minute it was ‘Oh my goodness, my eyes are burning terribly.’ I’m crying. We had the masks on too, which seemed to make it even worse.”</li></ul></div></div>

Ray, who had two cameras around his neck, was not wearing a press pass at the time, but doubted that would have helped under the circumstances. The blow “came out of nowhere. It wasn’t a situation where I was being asked to show credentials or anything.”</p><p>The pain from the injury grew throughout the day but had dissipated by the next morning, he said.</p><p>Around 6:46 p.m., Cerise Castle, a reporter for KCRW, a Santa Monica NPR affiliate, was reporting at Beverly Boulevard and Fairfax Avenue when she reported being hit by a rubber bullet. She was holding her press badge above her head at the time, she <a href=""https://twitter.com/cerisecastle/status/1266878695555231747?s=19"">tweeted</a>.</p><p>In a statement emailed to the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker, Castle said the incident occurred when she was photographing a group of LAPD officers in riot gear who had just arrived in the back of an open truck.</p><p>“As I was snapping photos, the police descended from their vehicle and began pointing rifles at the crowd. People started to run, I held my ground and continued to take pictures. This is when the shooting started, without warning or prior order to disperse,” she wrote. “I screamed after the first gunshot, then pulled myself together and began yelling PRESS and removed my lanyard from my neck, and held it above my head.”</p><p>The rubber bullet that hit her arm above the elbow crease was fired by an officer with whom she had just locked eyes with, she added. As she ran away, she sprained her ankle and is currently on crutches.</p><p>Jintak Han, a photographer and reporter for the Daily Bruin, UCLA’s student newspaper, was wrapping up an afternoon reporting on the protests and trying to cross Beverly Boulevard to head back to his car around 7:15 p.m. when he found himself facing a police line that was clearing protestors block-by-block, he told the Committee to Protect Journalists via Twitter message.</p><p>Han was readily identifiable as a journalist, wearing a press pass, as well as a white helmet and a vest emblazoned with “PRESS,” and carrying three cameras.</p><p>Despite this, he said, an officer aimed his weapon at him, prompting Han to raise both hands in the air. He moved into an opening, and soon was standing “some distance away” from a group of four protestors who were shielding themselves behind a mattress when officers opened fire. “The rubber bullets fell short and hit the ground near my feet before I hid behind the mattress,” he told CPJ.</p></div></div>

Floyd was later pronounced dead at a hospital.</p><p>While Radzius was reporting alone, he told the Committee to Protect Journalists in a phone interview that he was near a group of reporters during the protests. The protest, one of many that took place across New York City on May 30, began at around 3 p.m. near Prospect Park and continued south to the Brooklyn neighborhood of Flatbush. Radzius characterized the protest as “largely peaceful” in a statement about the incident that he wrote for the police that he provided to CPJ. Radzius said in his interview and in the statement that he had a 1010 WINS microphone and people told him they liked the station and thanked him for reporting on the protest.</p><p>Radzius was carrying press credentials, but they were not displayed, he told CPJ. His 1010 WINS microphone flag was large and identified him clearly as media, he said.</p><p>According to Radzius’ statement to the police, a few hours into the protest, he followed a group of people who left the central location of the protest, thinking them to be protesters. The group and Radzius walked to College Wine and Liquors, a liquor store in Flatbush. Radzius witnessed a group of people loot the store, and filmed the entire incident on his cellphone for 30 seconds, before the store owner locked the door.

Radzius responded that he was talking to “all New Yorkers on the radio.” A few seconds later, Radzius says he heard a male voice shout, “Snitch.” Radzius was then struck from behind on the right side of his upper face.</p><p>Radzius does not know who hit him. A witness told him that the attacker was a man, and that he struck Radzius with an unidentified object.</p><p>After being hit, Radzius says he was “stunned.” He received medical assistance at the scene from a woman who identified herself as a nurse. He later went to the hospital. He sustained injuries to his face that required five stitches above his eye on the eyebrow.

As he ran away from the headquarters through a cloud of tear gas, camera in hand, police began shooting rubber projectiles in his direction. The first two projectiles hit Machowicz’s lower back and the side of his ribcage. In pain, he fell down.

He was standing behind a light post looking at his cell phone when a flying object he suspects to have been a tear gas canister bounced off the light post before hitting him squarely in the face, on his right eye. The U.S. Press Freedom Tracker could not confirm the type of object he was hit with.</p><p>A street medic in the crowd quickly found him and put gauze over the wound, and told Sands he needed to go to the hospital.

Gray told the Tracker that the officer said something to the effect of, “Alright, no no no, I’ll take him away.”</p><p>Officers then took Gray down the street and passed him off to another officer who was designated his arresting officer and was eventually listed on all of Gray’s arrest reports.</p><p>After being stripped of his equipment and re-cuffed, Gray waited on a prison transport bus with 50 to 60 others for half an hour until the rest of the seats were filled. He said he then waited an additional hour outside One Police Plaza due to the volume of arrestees that night.</p><p>“At this point, I feel like I’m just in the system and we’re going through with it, I’m being booked and that’s what’s happening. There’s nobody else there that I can speak to or remonstrate with,” Gray said.</p><p>After being processed, he was placed in a holding cell with 50-70 people crammed in shoulder-to-shoulder. Gray said that he still had a face mask in order to combat the spread of coronavirus, but most others did not.</p><p>Gray was released at around 9:30 a.m. — nearly 11 hours after his arrest — with a desk appearance ticket for unlawful assembly, a misdemeanor punishable by up to three months in jail and a $500 fine.</p><p>When asked for comment, an NYPD spokesperson directed the Tracker to the “30 minute mark” of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6eUFc_kltc"">a press briefing</a> held by New York Mayor Bill de Blasio and Police Commissioner Dermot Shea on June 3.</p><p>Around that point in the recording, Shea says: “The only thing that I might add on the point of the press: We’re doing the best we can, the difficult situation. We 100 percent respect the rights of the press. Unfortunately we’ve had some people purporting to be press that are actually lying, if you can believe that. So sometimes these things take a second — maybe too long — to sort out.”</p><p>The Manhattan district attorney announced in a <a href=""https://www.manhattanda.org/d-a-vance-declines-to-prosecute-protest-arrests/"">press release</a> on June 5 that his office would not prosecute unlawful assembly or disorderly conduct arrests.</p><p>The U.S. Press Freedom Tracker is documenting several hundred total incidents of journalists assaulted, arrested, struck by crowd control ammunition or tear gas or who had their equipment damaged while covering protests across the country related to the death of George Floyd while in police custody.

<div class=""block-rich_text""><div class=""rich-text""><p>Trahan Martinez told the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker that she was standing on a street corner at around 8 p.m. in downtown Dallas, filming demonstrators who were kneeling, when a group of two to three dozen police officers in riot gear approached.</p><p>When someone in the crowd lobbed a water bottle in the direction of the advancing officers, one of the officers issued a warning on his bullhorn to protesters: “Leave the area or you will be arrested.” Seconds later, the police sent canisters of tear gas into the crowd, causing protesters to scatter.</p><p>Trahan Martinez was filming the scene on her phone from a corner opposite the action, when the officers repeated their call to leave, this time in her direction. “I shouted, ‘I’m with the press. I’m media. I’m just working. I’m here doing my job,’” she recounted. When they responded with another command to clear the area, Trahan Martinez reiterated that she was a member of the press, in case they had not heard her.</p><p>“They screamed back, ‘It doesn’t matter,’” she said. Then they fired a canister of tear gas that landed a few feet behind her to her left.</p><p>“They started shooting at me,” she said, recounting that dark blue foam less-lethal projectiles fell at her feet. None of them hit her. Trahan Martinez walked away and took shelter in the patio of a closed restaurant until she was able to reach safety.</p><p>Trahan Martinez, who has worked as a reporter in Dallas for 20 years and has plenty of sources inside the Dallas Police Department, described the experience as a jarring one. “This particular unit did not care who I was or what I was doing there,” she said.</p><p>Reached by the Tracker, Warren Mitchell, a spokesman for the DPD, wrote in an email that it was “challenging” to provide comment about the incident without hearing the details from Trahan Martinez. Mitchell invited the reporter to make a complaint with the department.</p><p>Shortly after, in a nearby part of downtown, Dallas Morning News reporters Corbett Smith and Jesus Jiménez were documenting police efforts to clear out protesters outside of their newspaper’s office when a state trooper rolled a tear gas canister at them.</p><p>Smith said that the incident happened just after 8 p.m., when a state trooper, who was standing 20 to 25 yards away, made eye contact with Smith as the pair stood on South Harwood Street near the The Dallas Morning News headquarters.</p><p>“There&#x27;s a state trooper who turns and looks right at me,” Smith said, “and pulled the pin on the gas.” The trooper <a href=""https://twitter.com/corbettsmithDMN/status/1266899262719303681"">rolled the canister</a> toward Smith and Jiménez, but the canister “kind of skittered off to the west underneath a car that was 10 feet away.” The pair was able to quickly retreat, avoiding being enveloped by the gas.</p><p>There was no one standing between the journalists and the trooper at the time he rolled the canister at them, Smith said.</p><p>Both Smith and Jiménez said they were clearly identifiable as members of the media. “I feel like they could easily distinguish us as press,” Jiménez said. “We had our press passes on, our notebooks out and we were standing right in front of our office.”</p><p>“It was very clear who I was and what I was doing,” Smith said. “I never thought that I would have an officer do something like that.”</p><p>Smith identified the officer as a member of the Texas Department of Public Safety based on the shield he was carrying.</p><p>In response to a request for comment, a spokesperson from the Texas Department of Public Safety wrote in an email that the department “does not have a record of any of our personnel deploying a gas canister in the area of the Dallas Morning News offices in Dallas on the evening of May 30, 2020.”</p><p>The U.S. Press Freedom Tracker is documenting several hundred total incidents of journalists assaulted, arrested, struck by crowd control ammunition or tear gas or had their equipment damaged while covering protests across the country related to the death of George Floyd while in police custody.

Hyman also assumes the projectile was fired by police. At the time he was struck, Hyman says, there were officers in riot gear firing tear gas from the steps of the courthouse in downtown Raleigh. He was not standing in the direct line of fire and estimates that police were about 100 feet away from him at the time.</p><p>“It was not a very controlled situation,” said Hyman. “The police didn’t seem like they had control either.”</p><p>Hyman was wearing an N95 mask and goggles with a seal when he was struck.

The tweet, sent early in the morning of May 31, is captioned, “You’re going to feel that in the morning bud.”</p><p>On the same evening, photojournalist Brad Simmons of WRAL-TV, a North Carolina station, was also struck with a projectile while reporting, he told CPJ in a phone interview on June 5. Simmons was shooting video at the protest in Raleigh, which he said was “peaceful” until around 7:30, when it began to escalate.</p><p>“There was tear gas, people running. People started being a little bit more combative when law enforcement showed up,” Simmons says.</p><p>Simmons witnessed protesters throwing bottles and garbage can lids, as well as breaking windows and storefronts. At around 10:20, he was struck in the left knee by a rubber bullet. He assumes it was fired by police. Simmons estimates he was about 75 feet from police when he was struck. At the time he was struck, he saw many officers in riot gear.</p><p>Simmons doesn’t believe he was targeted for being a member of the media and thinks he was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time.</p><p>The Raleigh Police Department did not immediately respond to CPJ’s request for comment.</p><p>The U.S. Press Freedom Tracker is documenting several hundred total incidents of journalists assaulted, arrested, struck by crowd control ammunition or tear gas or had their equipment damaged while covering protests across the country related to the death of George Floyd while in police custody.

Upon review of the citation, Zoss said that the arresting agency was not listed, something he termed “unusual” and was likely a result of this being a mass arrest.</p><p>The arrest occurred despite the fact that members of the media were specifically exempt from Minnesota Governor Tim Walz’s <a href=""https://mn.gov/governor/news/#/detail/appId/1/id/434117"">executive order</a> implementing the curfew.</p><p>Derrien and Atalaya were released around 2 a.m. and had to find their way back to their car without their cellphones, which were locked inside their vehicle with their gear. A protester who was released at the same time gave them a ride back to the general area where their car was. When they returned to the car, they discovered that one of the tires had been deflated.</p><p>In France, Derrien and Atalaya’s colleagues were “worried sick” when they were unavailable for the live shot they were supposed to do at midnight. “They called our phones many times, so when we got to the car, we had 15 or 20 missed calls each,” Derrien said. “They were starting to imagine the worst.”</p><p>Derrien later <a href=""https://www.liberation.fr/planete/2020/06/04/la-liberte-de-la-presse-doublement-malmenee_1790362"">recounted</a> what transpired to French daily newspaper Libération and tweeted out a photo of the car’s damaged windshield, writing that the situation had left them with “more fear than harm.”</p></div></div>

They said something to the effect of “Get out of the way,” Boykin told the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker. He identified himself as a member of the media, and the officers walked by him, then turned around and arrested him.</p><p>“I said, ‘Why? I’m with the press.’ They said it doesn’t matter,” Boykin said, adding that he had a press ID with him but never got the chance to show it to the officers.</p></div></div>

He was carried back to a police van, where they removed his face mask to photograph him, then placed him in the back of the vehicle, which was so hot that Boykin said he worried he would pass out, something he has a history of doing in high temperatures.</p><p>“Even being in the back of the van was traumatizing, because I thought of Freddie Gray and how he died,” said Boykin, who is black, referencing a black man who died in Baltimore police custody in 2015. “The whole experience was totally outrageous.”</p><p>After an hour in the van, Boykin said he was placed on a prisoner transport bus with other arrestees and brought to NYPD headquarters in lower Manhattan, where he was processed and placed in a cell with 34 other prisoners for several hours. Very few of them had face masks, Boykin said, and he worried that these conditions risked exposing them to the coronavirus.</p><p>“I was in that cell for four hours, never told what was going on, never given an opportunity to make a phone call,” Boykin told the Tracker, adding that he also wasn’t read his Miranda rights during the arrest. He was released at 9:30 p.m., six hours after his arrest, and given a summons to appear in court in September on misdemeanour charges of disorderly conduct and obstructing traffic.</p><p>“Mind you, I wasn’t blocking the highway—the police and the protesters were blocking the highway,” Boykin <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=26&amp;v=tojt5i0dNV4&amp;feature=emb_title"">later told CNN’s Don Lemon</a>. “I was in between the two of them, documenting what was happening.”</p><p>After that CNN appearance, Boykin told the Tracker that he was contacted by the New York City mayor’s office, which apologized to him for his treatment. He has also filed a complaint with the attorney general’s office. But to date, the charges have not been dropped, and he is prepared to fight them in court. He said the NYPD also failed to give him his ID back with the rest of his possessions following his release, and he needs to figure out a way to retrieve that.</p><p>The NYPD did not immediately return a request for comment.</p><p>“I thought it was completely unbelievable and unacceptable,” said Boykin of the experience. “This was a clear violation of my First Amendment rights.”</p><p>The U.S. Press Freedom Tracker is documenting several hundred total incidents of journalists assaulted, arrested, struck by crowd control ammunition or tear gas or had their equipment damaged while covering protests across the country related to the death of George Floyd while in police custody.

The man, who was dressed in black body armor decorated with a red medic cross, menanced them with his crowbar while shouting, “Give us all your stuff,” before running off and swinging his crowbar at someone else in the area, Lagoe recounted.</p><p>This provided enough of a distraction to enable Lagoe and Krinke to back away from both men, and round the corner and quickly head back to their car, Lagoe said. They drove a few blocks away and set up to do a live shot, and the man with the crowbar drove by them, swearing at them through an open window.</p><p>Afterward, Krinke tweeted about the experience:</p></div></div>

Floyd was pronounced dead at a local hospital. Protests against police brutality and in support of the Black Lives Matter movement have been held across the United States since the end of May.</p><p>Dike-Anukam and several other colleagues contributing to This Is Reno were reporting on a small crowd gathered outside City Hall as evening drew close. The crowd had splintered from a rally of hundreds of Black Lives Matter protesters who had marched through downtown Reno, Nevada, that day, according to the <a href=""https://www.rgj.com/story/news/2020/05/30/hundreds-gather-reno-protest-george-floyds-death/5291340002/"">Reno Gazette Journal</a>.</p><p>The mood at City Hall had darkened as Dike-Anukam began <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/donwil/videos/10101401363538269/"">to livestream</a> on Facebook at around 7 p.m. Dike-Anukam’s livestream and <a href=""https://twitter.com/luciastarbuck/status/1266913483481739264"">other</a> <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/david.leon.77398/videos/3036035949819497/?story_fbid=3036035949819497&amp;id=100002393648230"">videos</a> from the scene show people breaking the windows and entrance of the building. At one point, a chair is thrown from the inside of the building, shattering a window. An alarm wails as a Nevada flag smolders.</p><p>Suddenly someone yells, “We got the gavel!” Dike-Anukam approaches a person in a white bandana and baseball cap. “Where did that come from? Where did that come from? Did you go in the chambers?” Dike-Anukam tries to ask in the livestream.</p><p>“Turn that shit off,” the gavel holder says. He pushes away Dike-Anukam’s phone before walking away.</p><p>Two other people immediately confront Dike-Anukam. The livestream is largely unintelligible, but it appears to show a woman covering her face with blue fabric shouting expletives at Dike-Anukam as a man in an NBA All-Star sweatshirt stands by her side.</p><p>Dike-Anukam told the Tracker he believes the woman called him “Reno” because she saw his This Is Reno press badge hanging from his neck.</p><p>Suddenly, the camera is knocked to the ground. Another <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/david.leon.77398/videos/3036035949819497/?story_fbid=3036035949819497&amp;id=100002393648230"">video</a> posted to Facebook shows a fourth person, in black, who was originally standing next to the person with the gavel, backtrack toward Dike-Anukam. He swipes at Dike-Anukam’s camera before walking away through the crowd.</p><p>Dike-Anukam picks up his still-streaming camera and tries to walk away. But the woman and the man in the NBA sweatshirt follow him. Off camera, she warns Dike-Anukam, “You’re still gonna get jumped.”</p><p>“I don’t care. I don’t care. The First Amendment wins,” Dike-Anukam responds in the livestream.</p><p>Then, chaos breaks loose on the livestream in a garbled, 30-second mess of shouting as the feed goes black.</p><p>Dike-Anukam said he wasn’t certain if the woman was warning or threatening him, he told the Tracker. But he knew the crowd had grown increasingly aggressive toward the press. Earlier, he had watched protesters attempt to block a cameraman from the local NBC affiliate, KRNV, from filming the defacing of an American flag at police headquarters.</p><p>Dike-Anukam explained to the Tracker he felt “a strong feeling, a sense of duty and conviction” to continue reporting.</p><p>Ty O’Neil, a freelance photographer on assignment for This Is Reno, told the Tracker he was standing on a nearby ledge trying to photograph the crowd when he saw someone punch Dike-Anukam in the back of the head. In the chaos of the moment, O’Neil said he didn’t know who threw the punch, but a review of his photographs that day showed the man in the NBA sweatshirt making a fist right before Dike-Anukam was hit.</p><p>O’Neil ran toward his colleague as several people punched and kicked Dike-Anukam, who had fallen to the ground. <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/david.leon.77398/videos/3036035949819497/?story_fbid=3036035949819497&amp;id=100002393648230"">Video</a> shows the woman with a blue head covering joining the fray after Dike-Anukam was punched.</p><p>Dike-Anukam tried to protect his face, his vital organs and his phone, which contained all his footage, as best he could, he told the Tracker. As he was curled into a ball, shielding himself against multiple assailants punching, kicking and pulling at him, Dike-Anukam heard someone urge the others to go for his camera.</p><p>Lucia Starbuck, another This Is Reno contributor and reporter for NPR affiliate KUNR, filmed the assault. Her <a href=""https://twitter.com/luciastarbuck/status/1266916902464413696"">video</a> appears to show some protesters attempting to stop the attack. Someone in a black sweatshirt throws the woman who had accosted Dike-Anukam to the ground.</p><p>O’Neil jumped into the melee to try to save Dike-Anukam.</p><p>“I shoved a bunch of people out of the way, and I grabbed Don’s shoulders and he looked up at me,” said O’Neil, his voice cracking. “He had these giant eyes of fear, and that’s definitely the thing that kind of stuck with me, how awful to see him like that was.”</p><p>Dike-Anukam said: “Had Ty not jumped in there and separated the crowd and pulled me out, I wouldn’t have made it … I would’ve sustained significant physical damage.”</p><p>“I grabbed him under the arm on his left side and I picked him up. And I just started running,” O’Neil said. “There were so many people around us. Just punches and kicks and, you know, chaos.”</p><p>Then the tear gas came.</p><p>It isn’t clear if the police, who up until this point had been conspicuously absent from City Hall, fired tear gas in an attempt to stop the assault or whether they coincidentally engaged the crowd at the same moment.</p><p>The Reno Police Department didn’t respond to multiple inquiries seeking comment.</p><p>Everyone — the journalists, those who were attacking them and those who were trying to save them — all fled from the cloud of gas.</p><p>“I just was recovering from getting my ass kicked, in a daze, and now all of a sudden I’m choking on this vile thing that’s got in my eyes,” Dike-Anukam said. “Everything hurts. My head is throbbing at this point. I’m wondering, am I bleeding?”</p><p>Despite the assault — and losing his glasses as a result — Dike-Anukam continued to report well into the night, as officials declared the gathering an <a href=""https://twitter.com/ChiefJasonSoto/status/1266939136163721216"">unlawful assembly</a> and imposed a <a href=""https://twitter.com/MayorSchieve/status/1266916816586072065"">curfew</a>.</p><p>The following day, Dike-Anukam was diagnosed with a minor concussion, he told the Tracker. As of June 22, he was still feeling the effects of the assault and planned to return to receive follow-up care, he said.</p><p>O’Neil said he didn’t feel some of the blows from the crowd as his adrenaline surged. The next day, he discovered a bruise on his chest, but he didn’t know what caused it.</p><p>Dike-Anukam told the Tracker he filed a police report about the assault. On June 18, <a href=""https://www.rgj.com/story/news/2020/06/18/reno-police-seek-help-identifying-suspects-attack-journalist/3215535001/?fbclid=IwAR2pDZZKx8yvNm67z1lzI3syQraDWecPn-2gbQ0f-rYUhr-mwG0nUQGTHNE"">the Reno Police Department</a> said it had identified the woman with a blue head covering and the man in the NBA sweatshirt as suspects in the assault and asked the public to help identify them.</p><p>Police chief and acting city manager Jason Soto said that the department was reviewing video and media reports to make arrests for crimes committed during the protest, according to <a href=""https://thisisreno.com/2020/05/riots-in-reno-after-peaceful-black-lives-matter-demonstration-videos-and-photos/"">This Is Reno</a>. He denounced the assault on Dike-Anukam, saying the journalist was a “personal friend of mine through the media, and it breaks my heart that he was injured.”</p><p>In a personal account of the attack for <a href=""https://www.press.org/newsroom/student-member-gives-first-person-account-being-injured"">the National Press Club</a>, Dike-Anukam wrote that his heart, too, was broken by the events of May 30. He noted the irony of a Black journalist being assaulted while covering a protest in response to the killing of Floyd, an unarmed Black man.</p><p>But the assault didn’t blunt his dedication to journalism. “I am not deterred, scared, or less in love with this profession,” he wrote.</p><p>The U.S. Press Freedom Tracker is documenting several hundred incidents of journalists assaulted, arrested, struck by crowd control ammunition or tear gas or had their equipment damaged while covering protests across the country.

Floyd, a black man, was later pronounced dead at a hospital.</p><p>Pinto, who was covering the protests for New York outlet Gothamist, told the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker that the Saturday evening protest in the Flatbush neighborhood was “the most mayhem I&#x27;ve seen on the streets of New York City ever.”</p><p>By the time Pinto arrived in the late afternoon, tensions between the protesters and police in riot gear were at a fever pitch. The two sides were facing off in the street, Pinto said, when the New York Police Department pushed the crowd north up Bedford Avenue. Some protesters were throwing objects at the officers, including plastic and glass bottles, but also more dangerous projectiles, Pinto said.</p><p>“I saw fire extinguishers, bricks, chunks of concrete the size of footballs; I saw a cop take a giant chunk of brick and concrete in the neck and go down and I feel certain that that cop is not OK,” Pinto told the Tracker. “The police would respond by pepper-spraying indiscriminately, charging into the crowd with bats, busting people up, making some really hard arrests, dragging them back while the crowd chants ‘shame!’ And then they would reset and do it all again. This lasted for eight hours.”</p><p>When the crowd came across any police vehicles that had been left unattended, they would vandalize them and set them on fire, Pinto said. Other anti-police partisans climbed on the roof of gas stations to throw objects at officers in an environment that Pinto compared to “urban combat.”</p><p>When the moving conflict reached the intersection of Bedford and Church avenues, the police broke up the crowd into smaller groups that the officers pursued. During this time, Pinto was hit in the back of the neck by pepper spray, which he said felt like a “very strong Tiger Balm.” Later, Pinto would inadvertently touch the back of his neck and then his eyes, resulting in a much more painful burning sensation.</p><p>The journalist, who was wearing a press pass around his neck, told the Tracker that he was not specifically targeted by the pepper spray, but soon had a more direct encounter with an officer. Pinto was on the sidewalk on Church Avenue moving away from the line of police officers who repeatedly told him to move. He said he displayed his credentials and identified himself as a member of the media.</p><p>“I was not moving fast enough for their satisfaction. And it was a challenge to their authority,” Pinto said. One officer “locked eyes on me, came at me, pushed me, knocked me to the ground. It tore open my pants and bloodied both my knees.”</p><p>“I got back up, and I was like, ‘Hey, I&#x27;m press, I&#x27;m doing my job. I understand you&#x27;re doing your job, but, just respect what I&#x27;m doing,’” Pinto continued. The officer replied, “‘No, you have to respect what I&#x27;m doing.’ And I asked for his badge number and he gave it to me. I asked for his name and he gave it to me. But I was rattled enough that I was unable to read the name that I wrote—my hand was shaking.”</p><p>Pinto was not detained or charged with any crime. In a <a href=""https://pressfreedomtracker.us/all-incidents/freelance-photojournalist-pushed-ground-nyc-officers-during-protests/"">separate incident the night of June 4</a> in Brooklyn, Pinto said he was shoved to the ground by officers during a scrum with protesters. Pinto told the Tracker that he is unsure whether he’ll file a complaint with the NYPD about the officer’s behavior on May 30 or about the incident a few nights later.</p><p>“I&#x27;m trying to decide whether I particularly feel like talking to the police about the police,” he said. “But I may yet do so.”</p><p>The NYPD did not respond to a request for comment about the incident.</p><p>The U.S. Press Freedom Tracker is documenting several hundred incidents of journalists assaulted, arrested, struck by crowd control ammunition or tear gas or had their equipment damaged while covering protests across the country.

The tear gas in the air caused his eyes to burn. Migala worked his way toward the south side of the station and crossed the street to distance himself from the protesters.</p><p>“I was wearing a bright yellow safety vest with my ‘MEDIA’ badge on the front,” Migala wrote. “I stood alone, away from any of the protesters so that I wouldn’t be mistaken for one of them. But despite standing there, alone, for about 20 minutes, I was shot with a pepper spray paintball in the leg.”</p><p>Migala told the Tracker that the pepper ball hit his right thigh, leaving a large amount of the chemical irritant powder on his leg.</p><p>Police continued to engage with protesters over the next hour, he said, firing various crowd control munitions to disperse the demonstrators.</p><p>“I had been there for so long that my back started hurting,” Migala said. “So, I sat on the curb in front of the postal office across the street from the police station, pretty far from the main demonstrators.”</p><p>As he sat there, police suddenly fired pepper balls at him again, striking him an additional two to four times, he said.</p><p>“One of the pellets exploded and a bunch of the powder went into my nose, my mouth and in my eyes,” he said. “I was instantly incapacitated.”</p><p>Migala said a couple of young women were able to lead him to safety. One woman held his camera, glasses and hat as the other rinsed out his eyes for at least five minutes.</p><p>He added that the powder was still covering his respirator mask, face, clothes and beard when he got to his car, and caused him significant difficulty breathing. The following day, some powder residue still covered his camera, and when he attempted to brush it off, his eyes watered and became irritated.</p><p>“Just molecules of that stuff is enough to irritate your eyes with burning pain,” he said.</p><p>Migala told the Tracker and wrote about a second journalist who was also struck with a projectile — believed to have been a rubber bullet — while covering the protests that day. The Tracker was unable to identify the journalist as of press time.</p><p>East County Magazine Editor Miriam Raftery told the Tracker that they don’t know for sure that Migala was intentionally targeted. ”It seems to me they should have been able to see that he was media,” she said.</p><p>The La Mesa Police Department did not respond to phone requests for comment.</p><p>The U.S. Press Freedom Tracker is documenting several hundred incidents of journalists assaulted, arrested, struck by crowd control ammunition or tear gas or had their equipment damaged while covering protests across the country related to the death of George Floyd while in police custody.

As protesters returned to the march’s starting point, some people started smashing store windows and spray-painting walls, he said.</p><p>At that point, Gorden suggested to his producers to throw the live broadcast to him. When the light on the camera turned on, Gorden said, his group became a target.</p><p>As he was getting ready to go live, someone began pushing a sign toward the camera shot.</p><p>Security guard Jesse Torrez, a private security contractor the station hired to accompany news crews during the protests, told the Tracker that when the camera light turned on, several people rushed toward the cameraman, with one individual holding a sign moving toward Gorden. Torrez put his hand out to stop the person with the sign. As he was holding that person back, someone else struck him over the head with a hard object. Torrez believes it may have been a metal pipe.</p><p>Gorden saw a scuffle out of the corner of his eye. When he looked to see what had happened, he saw Torrez bleeding from his head. Both Torrez and his partner were carrying firearms, and they put their hands on their weapons. The crowd eventually dispersed.</p><p>After safely getting out of the area, Torrez went to the hospital to seek medical attention. He had four staples put into the laceration on his head, and had to go to a concussion clinic for two months, he said. For a month after the attack, Torrez said he couldn’t drive because his equilibrium was off as a result of the head injury.</p><p>A Scottsdale Police Department spokesperson confirmed that the incident has been reported and that police have an open investigation for aggravated assault. However, no suspects have been identified and no arrests have been made.</p><p>Gorden doesn’t believe that he and his colleagues were targeted because they were journalists. He said tensions were running high that night, and when the sign was pushed out of the way, they escalated.</p><p>“Anything could spark violence in that situation,” Gorden said. “In that moment, windows were being broken out, there was kind of this fervor that sort of really, really escalated throughout the crowd.”</p><p>The U.S. Press Freedom Tracker is documenting several hundred incidents of journalists assaulted, arrested, struck by crowd-control ammunition or tear gas, or had their equipment damaged while covering protests across the country.

The protests kicked off after the release of a video showing a white Minneapolis police officer kneeling on the neck of George Floyd, a Black man, during an arrest. Floyd was later pronounced dead in a hospital.</p><p>Mayorca arrived at the protest at Beverly Boulevard in the Fairfax neighborhood of Los Angeles around 3:30 p.m. with two crew members, including her brother Jonathan. She and Jonathan began to film the demonstrations. <a href=""https://youtu.be/5bSNF3DSzZk"">Mayorca’s footage</a> shows demonstrators on the boulevard chanting, holding signs, facing off with a line of police officers and then walking with their hands up.</p><p>When the demonstrators started to move west on Beverly Boulevard, Mayorca followed and continued filming. At about 4 p.m., protesters headed down an alleyway near Beverly Boulevard and North Fairfax Avenue. The Los Angeles Police Department had blocked off all other streets and directed protesters in the direction of the alleyway verbally and with their hands, Mayorca said. The police then kettled the demonstrators in the alley, blocking off exits and trapping protesters.</p><p>“They started to kettle people and we thought we should be OK because we’re press,” Mayorca said.</p><p>Mayorca wore a press badge that hung from a lanyard around her neck. She and her brother told police officers they were press, but they were ignored, she said.</p><p>Soon, Los Angeles police rushed in. <a href=""https://twitter.com/Fiorella_im/status/1267359859386707969"">Video</a> of the police entering the alleyway reviewed by the Tracker does not appear to pick up an audible warning from police. Officers began arresting protesters and journalists, including Mayorca and her brother.</p><p>Mayorca was put in handcuffs and then pushed up against a wall by a police officer, she said.</p><p>“[A woman officer was] seriously groping me. She went in my underwear. They were acting like we were hiding drugs,” she told the Tracker.</p><p>Officers placed zip-tie handcuffs on Mayorca. She said they felt extremely tight.</p><p>“The worst part of it was the wrists,” Mayorca said. “The way they placed it, it was like our wrists were going in different directions, not a normal position. It hurt.”</p><p>After spending about an hour in a police wagon, she and her brother were taken to the Van Nuys police station in Los Angeles, where she said she was held for about two hours and then released.</p><p>Mayorca was given a citation for failure to obey a lawful order, a misdemeanor charge.</p><p>The Tracker asked the LAPD to comment on Mayorca’s arrest, including allegations that she was groped while detained by police.</p><p>In response, the department referred the Tracker to a statement <a href=""http://www.lapdonline.org/home/news_view/66668"">published in June</a>.</p><p>“The Los Angeles Police Department continues to investigate allegations of misconduct, violations of Department policy, and excessive force during the recent civil unrest,” the statement reads. “The Department has assigned 40 investigators to this effort and we will look into every complaint thoroughly and hold every officer accountable for their actions.”</p><p>In June, Los Angeles City Attorney Mike Feuer <a href=""https://www.lacityattorney.org/post/feuer-takes-restorative-non-punitive-approach-outside-the-court-system-for-peaceful-protesters"">said</a> his office would be resolving the cases of peaceful protesters arrested during recent Black Lives Matter protests in a “non-punitive” way.</p><p>Jorge Gonzalez, a civil rights attorney who’s part of a team representing protesters arrested during the recent demonstrations, said the Los Angeles City Attorney has tentatively agreed to dismiss the charges, on the condition that protesters complete an online course on the First Amendment. Gonzalez said Aug. 3 that the team is rejecting the city’s condition and awaiting the city’s response.</p><p>Rob Wilcox, a spokesman for City Attorney Feuer, told the Tracker protesters will be invited to a voluntary, virtual conversation about policing, bias, and inequity organized with the help of local cultural, academic and criminal justice institutions.</p><p>Mayorca’s brother Jonathan is a named plaintiff in a <a href=""https://nlg-la.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/06/AMENDED-COMPLAINT-ECF.pdf"">class-action lawsuit</a> against the LAPD for allegedly violating protesters’ constitutional rights to peacefully assemble and protest, using excessive force, and holding protesters in unlawful conditions of confinement.

Sanchez is a visual journalist with KPCC/LAist, a Southern California-based public media network.</p><p>The protests in Los Angeles were sparked by a video showing a white police officer kneeling on the neck of George Floyd, a Black man, during an arrest in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on May 25. Floyd was pronounced dead at a local hospital. Demonstrations against police brutality and in support of the Black Lives Matter movement have been held across the United States since the end of May.</p><p>Sanchez told the Tracker he arrived at Pan Pacific Park at around 1 p.m. to document a Black Lives Matter protest. A couple thousand people had congregated at the park, he said. Protesters then marched through the city’s Fairfax District.</p><p>Sanchez said he first encountered law enforcement, who represented the Los Angeles Police and Los Angeles County Sheriff’s departments, between 3 and 5 p.m. A police vehicle had been lit on fire near the intersection of Fairfax Avenue and Third Street. Law enforcement formed a line to prevent protesters from moving west, creating a tense stand-off, Sanchez said.</p><p>Sanchez, who was wearing his press badge, wanted to cross the police line to document what the protests looked like from the other side. But when he approached the line to cross, a Los Angeles Police officer wearing dark blue or black riot gear shoved him back with a baton, Sanchez said.</p><p>“I said multiple times, ‘I’m press,’ and after I ID’d as press, they did relax a bit, but they did not allow me to cross their line,” Sanchez told the Tracker.</p><p>His second encounter with law enforcement came around 5:30 or 6 p.m., he said. By then, the police had closed down streets to move protesters toward La Brea Avenue, east of Fairfax. Sanchez had decided to go home, but he noticed another stand-off between law enforcement and protesters near Beverly Boulevard and Stanley Avenue. He stopped to take photos of the confrontation.</p><p>After bottles were thrown at law enforcement, the police fired tear gas canisters to disperse the crowd. Sanchez said city police officers and county sheriffs were present when the tear gas was shot.</p><p>“You hear pops, then you see canisters, and you see a cloud of smoke,” Sanchez said. “At that point I couldn’t see anymore. It went full on to my face.”</p><p>Protesters assisted Sanchez by pouring milk in his eyes, which provides some temporary relief from the burning feeling caused by exposure to tear gas. Sanchez, who goes by his nickname, Chava, rather than Jose Salvador, tweeted his appreciation to protesters for their help.</p></div></div>

Floyd was later pronounced dead at a hospital.</p><p>O’Driscoll told the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker that May 30 was the first big day of protests in Pittsburgh, with demonstrations beginning downtown around 2 p.m. He took over for a colleague covering the protests for WESA at around 5 p.m.</p><p>“In a familiar pattern now, the protest had started quite peacefully: Protesters were blocking the streets, marching, chanting, blocking the streets, etc.,” he said. “After a couple of hours, there was an incident where an unoccupied police car was set on fire. A second car was then set on fire in the same area.

A little after 4 p.m., she <a href=""https://twitter.com/gramsofgnats/status/1266868429211852801"">noted on Twitter</a>: “Plumes of tear gas on Pine near Westlake #SeattleProtest.” The ACLU announced on June 9 that it had filed an emergency lawsuit against the city on behalf of Black Lives Matter Seattle-King County and several individuals, arguing that “the use of chemical agents and projectiles for crowd control violate the First and Fourth Amendments.” Graham was among the plaintiffs. In her <a href=""https://www.aclu-wa.org/docs/graham-declaration"">declaration</a>, she relayed the following: “The scene when I arrived [at Westlake Park in downtown Seattle] was clouded by gas, with protesters scattering and sprinting away. The atmosphere was tense and frightening. I immediately felt the effects of the gas and began coughing. My eyes stung and watered. Although there did not appear to be any risk of violence from the crowd, law enforcement continued to fire flash bangs and tear gas, increasing the chaos. I took video footage of these protests and the violence that ensued. I was determined to continue reporting, so I began roving around the Westlake area, observing the scene. As I approached the corner of 6th and Stewart, I saw a group of protesters peacefully kneeling in the intersection as a speaker addressed them. I stood on the sidewalk nearby and listened to the speaker for a while, but then I heard an explosion from down the street. I turned and moved partway down the block to see what was happening, and then watched as a police line advanced down the street towards me, with other demonstrators fleeing in front of them. They deployed tear gas, which filled the street like plumes of smoke. It was not clear to me that the people fleeing the approaching police line and tear gas had done anything to provoke such an aggressive response. The protesters kneeling in the intersection, who were also impacted by the tear gas, had been completely peaceful. I did not see what happened next, but given the amount of gas in the air, I imagine that the kneeling protesters would have been forced to scatter. I wanted to continue to document the situation, but the gas reached me seconds later, and I had to leave. Its effects were so powerful, so painful, and so alarming that I was physically unable to remain in the intersection. As a result, I was unable to continue reporting on that incident. Shortly afterward, on E. Pine St, I saw a truck playing music, as protesters danced around it. It was an uplifting, joyful scene that contrasted with the warlike chaos of the panicked demonstrators and tear gas in other areas of the neighborhood. I paused to observe and record a video, when law enforcement threw a flash bang grenade into the crowd without warning. They deployed tear gas seconds later. The dancing protesters at first scattered, but then coalesced back into a group. Law enforcement pushed them back and continued to deploy tear gas and flash bangs. I was shocked and frightened by the consistently unprovoked, aggressive use of force by law enforcement officers on multiple different groups of peaceful protesters. I saw no evidence that any of these severe crowd-dispersal tactics were warranted, and there was never any warning before they were deployed. At this point, I decided to leave the area, because I feared for my safety. There was tear gas everywhere, flash bang grenades exploding in the street, and I was anxious that the police would further escalate their tactics. I decided that reporting on the situation was no longer worth the pain of enduring tear gas and the risk of suffering violence at the hands of law enforcement.”</li></ul></div></div>

She told the Tracker that the protest had been going on for about an hour and a half when police, who’d had a large presence at the scene, became agitated and made a wall of bicycles in front of thousands of peaceful protesters. Harris said she didn’t see this incident transpire explicitly, but it seemed apparent that a demonstrator had thrown an object at the officers, who then pepper-sprayed the crowd. Later, she said, more officers arrived and tear-gassed the crowd. Harris said she was assisted by protesters when the tear gas blocked her airways. They poured milk and saline solution on her face, until she was able to breathe again. She said that people from the back of the crowd began to throw bottles at the police, who then fired on the crowd with tear gas canons. Harris said she began to have serious trouble breathing and started to throw up. Some demonstrators helped to get her out of the area. “The protesters immediately came and sprayed my eye and offered milk and saline,” she said. “I took the spray of water and baking soda and started to be able to breathe. I recovered and went back to the area to shoot the arrests that were taking place.”</li></ul><p>Harris was struck by a projectile fired by police the following day while covering protests in Louisville, Kentucky, a case the Tracker has documented <a href=""https://pressfreedomtracker.us/all-incidents/photographer-hit-projectile-tear-gas-while-covering-protests-louisville/"">here</a>.</p><ul><li><b>Kyle Robertson</b>, a staff photographer for the Columbus Dispatch, told the Tracker that he was pepper-sprayed by law enforcement while covering a protest adjacent to the Capitol. Robertson said that as the size of the protest grew, groups of police officers on bicycles had moved to create a barricade and contain protesters to the sidewalk area and keep them off the street. Robertson said that a protester either tripped or was pushed into the street and that police officers immediately jumped on this person. Robertson said that local government officials who had been standing between the police and the protesters tried to intervene to deescalate the situation. He said he moved to photograph the altercation among the protesters, the officers and the government officials when the police began to use pepper spray on the crowd. Robertson said he took pepper spray on one side of his face and arm and on his camera gear. Unable to see in the moments after the attack, he said an individual grabbed him and pulled him aside and led him back to a local business along South High Street, where the man soaked his bandana in saline and helped him to clean himself and his camera. Robertson said the individual told him, “They were aiming for you,” but as he was focusing on photographing when the attack occurred, he said he hadn&#x27;t seen what had happened and that he couldn&#x27;t say if he’d been targeted. Noting his height — Robertson is 6-foot-4 — he said it was possible he stood out in the crowd and was clearly visible to the officers shooting the pepper spray. After a short break, Robertson said he soon went back to work. “I kept shooting with one eye and didn’t stop for several hours,” he said.</li><li>Another Dispatch journalist, <b>Lucas Sullivan</b>, <a href=""https://twitter.com/DispatchSully/status/1266750146693550080"">tweeted</a> around 11:15 that morning, noting that both he and Robertson had been pepper-sprayed.

Ten minutes earlier, protesters had smashed windows and thrown trash cans, but there were now only a few scattered people on the sidewalks and in the street, including a medic and another photographer, and no one within 10 feet of him, he said. “Out of nowhere, from the other side of the intersection, a tear gas canister flew in and landed by the right side of my feet,” McGee told the Tracker. “Then another lands and spikes to the ground by the left side of my feet and bounced a few feet behind me.” McGee said he moved fast enough to evade most of the gas, but he felt some irritation on his face. He didn’t capture the incident on video but afterward posted a message to Twitter about his experience. McGee said he believes he was clearly identifiable as a member of the press because he was wearing a laminated press badge around his neck and had been filming in the vicinity of police officers all evening. “It was either a misfire and mistaken strategy, or maybe someone decided intentionally to do that with a couple journalists in the street. But all of that is speculation,” McGee told the Tracker. A spokesperson for the Raleigh Police Department said the department and an independent contractor for the city were reviewing the response to the incident. She declined to comment further.</li></ul></div></div>

<div class=""block-rich_text""><div class=""rich-text""><p>On June 18, the Seattle Police Department issued subpoenas to five area news outlets, requesting all video footage and photographs taken on May 30 from 3:30 to 5 p.m. within a four-block radius. The Tracker has documented that case, and its evolution, <a href=""https://pressfreedomtracker.us/all-incidents/seattle-police-department-subpoenas-five-news-outlets-protest-photos-videos/"">here</a>.</p><p><b>In Fort Wayne, Indiana</b></p><ul><li>A<b> WPTA ABC 21 television news crew</b> was threatened with arrest by an Indiana State Police trooper while covering protests in the city. WPTA news director Jonathan Shelley told the Tracker that he and other staff members had been caught in tear gas as they reported on the protests that day, but to his knowledge, it was never directed at the journalists. He said that shortly before 10 p.m., the police went through the streets with loudspeakers, announcing that an “unlawful assembly” had been declared and directing people to get off the streets. The news crew continued to stay on the scene, documenting arrests that were happening in the area. As they filmed a group of Fort Wayne Police Department officers handcuffing an individual, an Indiana State Police trooper not involved with the arrest noticed the journalists and “made a beeline toward us” from across the street, Shelley said. Video that Shelley took of the interaction shows the officer walking briskly toward the journalists. From a distance, he appeared to shout “walk” and “you’re next” at Shelley and his colleagues. The officer walked up close behind the news crew as they moved away from the area. “If I catch you, you’re going to jail,” the officer can be heard saying on the video. “I’m going to jail?” Shelley responded, then saying, “I’m press,” and “I’m moving out of the way.” “Then walk,” the officer can be heard saying. Shelley said the members of his group were clearly marked as journalists, wearing bright red jackets with the ABC 21 WPTA logo and press badges with their names and station affiliate visible. Sergeant Brian Walker of the Indiana State Police said in an emailed statement that Shelley alerted him to the situation and he shared the information with his superiors. He said he and Shelley discussed the situation and “the matter has been satisfactorily addressed” for both the news organization and the police. Shelley said in a follow-up email that his meeting with the Indiana State Police representative was productive and the matter was being addressed with the trooper. He said he was told that the Indiana State Police plans to use the video for training purposes in the future “in hopes of reducing the likelihood of future occurrences,” Shelley said. According to Shelley, there have also been broader discussions between local media and police, including the Fort Wayne Police Department, which took the lead on enforcement during the protest, and involving Indiana State Police. They discussed how the decision to declare “unlawful assembly” is reached and the rights journalists have to operate once such a declaration has been made, he said. In a separate incident later that day, Indiana State Police helped a WPTA journalist who’d sustained minor injuries when she fell while covering the protest. “Our experience as a team involved...examples of assistance to the press by law enforcement officers, as well as hindrance to the press in some cases. And so we kind of saw a little bit of both,” Shelley said.</li></ul><p><b>In Minneapolis/St. Paul, Minnesota</b></p><ul><li><b>Chao Xiong,</b> a Star Tribune reporter who’d been covering protests near the Minneapolis Police Department’s Fifth Precinct that evening, <a href=""https://twitter.com/ChaoStrib/status/1266959110265856000"">tweeted</a> a little after midnight: “I’m with @ByLizSawyer and 2 Kurdish journalists and 1 Japanese journalist near 5th precinct.

I showed my press badge and was told ‘doesn’t matter.’” She added in a thread a few minutes later: “Let me add that all my interactions with St. Paul police tonight were civil. Clear directions, polite tone. I also wasn’t in any tense situations once the protesters were diverted from crossing the Lake St. bridge.” Later that morning, around 9:30, Klecker shared a direct message sent by the St. Paul Police Department: “Hi Mara. We saw your tweet about the police officer you say told you to go home. That doesn’t sound like something we see from a SPPD officer because we work hard to protect freedom of the press. But in the throes of such a dynamic situation, it’s possible one of our officers had a momentary lapse. It also may be possible that the officer was from another agency. There were a lot of agencies involved last night. Either way, we’d love to learn more so we can see if there’s a gap in our training or at the very least talk to the officer so we can remind him about our values and protocols. Would you mind giving one of our PIOs a call this week?” Klecker’s reaction to the message, which she shared on Twitter, was, “Very nice to wake up to this message this morning. Saint Paul police PIOs (public information officers) also helped media get permission to get through road blocks to get where we needed to be last night.”</li></ul></div></div>

During an arrest, a white Minneapolis Police officer kneeled on Floyd’s neck and ignored Floyd’s pleas that he could not breathe. Floyd was later pronounced dead in a hospital.</p><p>Slade told the Committee to Protect Journalists that he was reporting on protests in downtown Minneapolis with three other VICE journalists when they encountered a long line of police in riot gear forming a wall to block the street. Slade said that the police began spraying tear gas and pepper spray. He realized that the crew — producers and camera operators Jike Gonzalez, Elis Rua, and Dave Mayer — needed to turn away to put on the gas masks they were carrying.</p><p>“We didn’t go into a peaceful protest wearing gas masks and flak jackets because visually that just says that you’re expecting trouble and that you’re looking for trouble,” Slade said.</p><p>The journalist said that he and his colleagues ducked into an alleyway and turned around to see that riot police had followed them.</p><p>“We immediately announced that we’re press, but they told us to get down on the ground,” Slade said. “We comply 100 percent. We get down on the ground and as a police officer walks toward us, I hold my credentials up and I say ‘I’m press, we’re press, sir!’,” Slade said.</p><p>A police officer then proceeded to use zip ties to secure Slade’s hands behind his back while his gas mask was still on, he said. The other crew members also had their hands zip tied behind their back.</p><p>“It is important to note that in this crew, there are four people and three of us are Black men,” Slade said.</p><p>Slade said that the officer, a Minnesota State Trooper, then asked to see his credentials. He managed to show the officer, despite having his hands tied behind his back. The journalist said he was then passed to another officer who placed Slade and his crew into a wagon in the middle of the street that was still thick with teargas and pepper spray. Police removed his gas mask while Gonzalez was sent to another part of the police wagon with other women.</p><p>“One of the crew asks for masks; they tell us we’re going to get masks when we get down to the station,” Slade said. Instead, he said, they sat in the van for about 25 minutes.</p><p>At the station, Slade said they waited for officers to figure out their case number before each crew member was fingerprinted.</p><p>“They gave us [each] a citation and VICE’s attorney immediately contacted the state of Minnesota and filed grievances,” Slade said. “The state of Minnesota assured us that [the citations] would not go on our record and that [they] would be dropped.”</p><p>About a week later, Slade and the other VICE crew members received a notification in the mail with a court date, Slade said. The notice said failure to appear would result in a bench warrant.</p><p>The Commissioner for the Department of Corrections has since confirmed to VICE that the dismissals are forthcoming, according to a VICE spokesperson, who corresponded with CPJ via email.</p><p>According to <a href=""https://www.twincities.com/2020/05/30/journalists-report-being-fired-on-gassed-in-minneapolis-george-floyd-protests/"">news reports</a>, the media was exempt from curfew the night the VICE crew was arrested.</p><p>“What added insult to injury is that we lost a night of coverage,” Slade said. “We were not able to cover the protests that night.

Within seconds of the warning, the police appear to use flash bang grenades and tear gas. They then begin to advance.</p><p>The video shows a line of State Patrol troopers, in maroon pants and helmets, and what appear to be Department of Natural Resources conservation officers in green pants and helmets approaching a group of journalists huddled on the side of the street. As previously reported by the <a href=""https://pressfreedomtracker.us/all-incidents/police-target-dozens-journalists-covering-protests-minneapolis-tear-gas-pepper-spray-rubber-bullets/"">Tracker</a>, State Patrol troopers pepper sprayed the group at close range as the journalists identified themselves as press.</p><p>Nelson and Shum had gas masks, but a third person working with them didn’t, Nelson said, so she escorted this person to safety as Shum stayed to film.</p><p>Shum and the other journalists fled from the advancing police. Several journalists attempted to turn west off Nicollet Avenue on West 31st Street, but found themselves trapped in an alcove on the corner of a building with no exit.

As Shum attempts to scale the wall with his large camera, an officer pushes him from behind.</p><p>Shum said he heard the officer order him to “get the fuck out of here,” before shoving him. “I was pushed hard enough where I sort of lost control and fell on my shoulder and arm,” he said.</p><p>He added he rolled through the fall and suffered superficial injuries as he tried to protect his camera and body.</p><p>L.A.

Niskanen added he couldn’t comment further on the incident because it “may be subject to ongoing litigation initiated against the State of Minnesota by multiple media members.”</p><p>Nelson and Shum have joined a <a href=""https://www.aclu-mn.org/en/press-releases/aclu-mn-sues-law-enforcement-over-attacks-journalists-covering-george-floyd-protests"">lawsuit</a> seeking class-action status filed by the ACLU of Minnesota against Minneapolis and state officials concerning the treatment of journalists covering the Floyd protests.</p><p>The Department of Public Safety, which oversees the State Patrol, didn’t respond to the Tracker’s emailed list of questions.

Floyd was pronounced dead at a local hospital. Protests against police brutality and in support of the Black Lives Matter movement have been held across the United States since the end of May.</p><p><a href=""http://www.ericrosenwaldphotography.com/"">Eric Rosenwald</a> was capturing footage of police and protesters outside the main police station in downtown Tucson around 10:30 p.m. when individuals in the crowd began to criticize him for filming them, claiming he was “with the police,” he told the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker in an interview.</p><p>Rosenwald, who was wearing a yellow safety vest adorned with a reflective patch that read “PRESS” and carrying a still camera, was clearly identifiable as a member of the media.</p><p>Rosenwald was first attacked by a young man in a blue baseball cap, who began to throw punches at him. The police line was about 20 yards away, and when officers noticed what was happening, they fired pepper balls at the ground near the attacker’s feet, affording Rosenwald the opportunity to escape, according to Rosenwald and video he furnished the Tracker of the encounter. He was not hit by any of the pepper balls nor did he inhale any of the powder they give off on impact.</p><p>Less than a minute later, an individual came up to Rosenwald and started screaming at him.</p><p>“You’re fucking antagonizing us right now. You’re fucking antagonizing us right now. This is a protest and we’re protesting you, motherfucker,” that individual said, according to <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/CA1G0ZMAts-/"">video footage</a>.</p><p>As this verbal attack continued, Rosenwald said he was pushed to the ground by a scrum of five people, who kicked him in the head, legs and torso before he was able to find his footing again.</p><p>Rosenwald’s iPhone, attached to a recording rig, slipped out of his hand during this attack, and someone stole the microphone that had been attached to it, he said. He recovered his phone and continued to film as he walked backward away from his attackers. The Arizona Daily Star posted <a href=""https://tucson.com/demonstrators-attack-photojounalist-language-alert/video_b6d1b339-1aed-5d1f-8d9b-21b348e2a6c8.html"">video</a> on its website of that attack in progress, captured from another angle by a journalist standing across the street.</p><p>About 30 minutes later, Rosenwald was attacked and pushed over again. During the course of the evening, he estimated he was punched or kicked 10 times, including three blows to the head that left him with large bruises and two black eyes. “I never left. I kept covering it,” Rosenwald said. “I think they realized I wasn’t going to go anywhere.”</p><p>One of his attackers later found him in the crowd and gloated about the newly forming bruises on his face. “Look at his dumbass face. Yeah, you got fucked up. Guess who hit you? Me, you punk-ass bitch,” one attacker gloated. Rosenwald <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/CA-D5cXA4Wp/"">posted video</a> of that encounter to his Instagram feed.</p><p>Rosenwald said that the attacks were unexpected, given that he was on a well-lit street next to the police station and near plenty of other journalists. He said that his attackers seemed to range in age from 18 to 25.</p><p>“What really scared me, in some ways worse than the physical part, was the complete ignorance as to what the First Amendment means,” Rosenwald said. “That was frightening to me as a journalist.”</p><p>Rosenwald’s bruises lingered for more than two weeks, but he did not suffer any long-term injuries from the attacks. He filed a report with the Tucson Police Department on June 6 but said he has yet to hear back. A request for comment emailed to the department was not immediately returned.</p><p>One of the individuals who attacked Rosenwald also accosted a reporter for the Arizona Daily Star, Caitlin Schmidt, and threw her cellphone.

Floyd, a Black man, was later pronounced dead at a hospital.</p><p>Marklund, who has been covering the protests since they began, told the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker that this particularly large gathering numbered in the hundreds or thousands. Police contained the protest by using portable fencing. Around 7:15 p.m., as tensions between protesters and police intensified, officers picked up the fencing and used it to push the crowd back. They also began to “go wild” with the pepper spray, Marklund said, and some of it landed on him.</p><p>Goggles and a facemask protected Marklund from the worst effects of the spray. But he said the spray also hit his exposed neck and arms, leaving him with a burning sensation that lasted for five or six hours. Marklund was wearing press credentials around his neck, but said that he wasn’t targeted for being a journalist. “They didn&#x27;t look to see if it was press or someone else,” he said of the officers.</p><p>Around 8:30 p.m. during the same protest, a police officer swung his baton near Marklund to force the crowd back. In the scrum, the photographer was struck by something — probably the baton, but he could not say for sure — that left a bruise the size of his hand on his stomach, he told the Tracker. Something also made contact with the lens and body of his camera. Marklund anticipated costly repairs to his camera but expected his insurance to cover most of the expense.</p><p>“The police were very, very aggressive,” Marklund told the Tracker. “They’ve been shoving me and other media every single night. It&#x27;s been very intense, but we haven&#x27;t been close to what I see other photographers and media have experienced in other cities where they’ve been shot at [with projectiles].

Rocks and bottles flung from the protesters’ side of a barricade were met with projectiles and tear gas from law enforcement, Rosas said.</p><p>But instead of advancing to enforce the curfew, police and National Guard troops began to withdraw from the area, Rosas said.</p><p>In a <a href=""https://twitter.com/Julio_Rosas11/status/1266550380193873920"">video</a> of the incident Rosas filmed from the sidewalk, law enforcement are seen backing past a burned-out building.

Rosas pans to the left as police fire projectiles toward a line of protesters down the street.</p><p>Then the sound of another shot rings out and the video cuts off. Rosas was hit in the torso. He would later <a href=""https://twitter.com/Julio_Rosas11/status/1266539093908959232"">tweet</a> a photo of a welt of about 40 millimeters in diameter, the same as some of the projectiles he saw being used.</p><p>Rosas, who was <a href=""https://pressfreedomtracker.us/all-incidents/journalist-hit-projectile-shot-minneapolis-police-vehicle/"">hit by what he believed was a pepper ball</a> the previous day, said the pain of getting hit by a 40mm projectile was on a different level.</p><p>“When I first got hit, on a scale of one to 10 pain-wise, it was a 10 for the first minute,” Rosas said. “And then I thought ‘Oh shoot I need to get out of here.’”</p><p>Rosas said he jumped over a small fence on the side of the road and landed on his back. Other people in the area helped him up and asked if he needed to go to the hospital. He wasn’t coughing up blood and didn’t feel pain breathing, so he went back to reporting, assuming he didn’t suffer serious internal damage. Later that night, he went to the hospital and received an official all-clear.</p><p>Capt. Melanie Nelson, a spokeswoman for the Minnesota National Guard, told the Tracker it “did not employ non-lethal rounds during the civil unrest in Minneapolis, Saint Paul and surrounding communities.”</p><p>The Minnesota Department of Public Safety, which oversees the State Patrol, didn’t respond to questions sent by the Tracker.</p><p>Rosas said he would be “very surprised” if he was hit by accident because there was no one around him.

Floyd was pronounced dead at a local hospital. Protests against police violence and in support of the Black Lives Matter movement have been held across the U.S. since the end of May.</p><p>Shum and Katie G. Nelson, a freelance journalist also reporting for the New York Times, were covering the fourth night of protests in Minneapolis on May 29. The night before, protesters overran and set fire to the Minneapolis Police Department’s Third Precinct. The focus on the 29th had shifted to the Fifth Precinct, Shum told the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker.</p><p><a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/video/us/100000007164958/protests-minneapolis-police.html"">Video</a> shot by Shum and Nelson shows hundreds of protesters gathered outside the station as police stand on the rooftop, ordering them to disperse. Police deploy tear gas and protesters aim laser pointers and shoot fireworks at police. The video ends with a line of police emerging through a thick cloud of either tear gas or smoke on Nicollet Avenue next to the station.</p><p>Shum said he and several other photojournalists filmed the officers as they began to fire projectiles. Protesters scattered by the tear gas were nearby, but the journalists stood together “obviously trying to get our shots,” Shum said.</p><p>Shum heard projectiles whizzing by his head before he was hit in the foot and side.</p><p>“I was trying to hold my shot realizing I could hear the whizzing by and I was like, OK, they are obviously shooting at us. And that’s when I got hit in the foot,” Shum said. “We should probably start running now.”</p><p>He said he wasn’t sure what kind of projectile hit him, though he suspected the one on his side was a ricochet given the force and angle of the impact.</p><p>The projectile that hit his foot “had more of an impact than I gave it credit for,” Shum said. His foot bruised with minor swelling. Walking was harder than normal but the injury didn’t require a doctor’s visit, he said.</p><p>Shum told the Tracker he believed the police didn’t specifically target him but were shooting indiscriminately in a general direction that included many journalists. He said he wasn’t sure which law-enforcement agency was responsible, or whether other journalists in the group were hit.</p><p>Protesters, journalists and even law-enforcement officials have had difficulty at times identifying specific officers during the protests. More than a <a href=""https://dps.mn.gov/divisions/ooc/news-releases/Pages/multi-agency-command-center-report-on-civil-unrest.aspx"">dozen</a> different agencies joined the law-enforcement effort in Minnesota, often wearing similar looking uniforms.</p><p>In a <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?v=545070406162328&amp;ref=watch_permalink"">livestream</a> filmed by Jeff Wagner, a reporter with CBS affiliate WCCO, the Minnesota State Patrol can be heard over loudspeaker just before 11:30 p.m. ordering people to disperse immediately. Within the next twenty minutes, <a href=""https://pressfreedomtracker.us/all-incidents/cnn-reporter-hit-projectile-tear-gassed-during-live-coverage-minneapolis-protest/"">several</a> <a href=""https://pressfreedomtracker.us/all-incidents/journalists-european-outlets-hit-projectiles-during-minneapolis-protest/"">journalists</a> were hit by police projectiles and tear gas fired by either State Patrol or Minneapolis Police, all within a block radius of where Shum was hit. Nine minutes after Wagner filmed the loudspeaker warning, he, too, was hit by a police projectile.</p><p>Minneapolis Police Department spokesman John Elder told the Tracker he couldn’t comment on Shum getting hit. He added that “every use of force by the MPD is under investigation internally.”</p><p>The Minnesota Department of Public Safety, which oversees the State Patrol, didn’t respond to the Tracker’s emailed list of questions.</p><p>Capt. Melanie Nelson, a spokeswoman for the Minnesota National Guard, told the Tracker that “the Minnesota National Guard did not employ non-lethal rounds during the civil unrest in Minneapolis, Saint Paul and surrounding communities.”</p><p>Despite the injury, Shum continued to report on the protests with Nelson. The following day, law-enforcement officers pushed him over a wall and fired on Nelson’s car in separate incidents, the journalists said.</p><p>Nelson and Shum have joined a class-action <a href=""https://www.aclu-mn.org/en/press-releases/aclu-mn-sues-law-enforcement-over-attacks-journalists-covering-george-floyd-protests"">lawsuit</a> filed by the ACLU of Minnesota against Minneapolis and Minnesota officials concerning the treatment of journalists covering the Floyd protests.</p><p>The U.S. Press Freedom Tracker is documenting several hundred incidents of journalists being assaulted, arrested, struck by crowd-control ammunition or tear gas, or having their equipment damaged while covering Black Lives Matter protests across the country.

Flash grenades poppin off. Crowd throwing items at cops. Also fireworks.” Half an hour later, he noted: “Police have fired tear gas into crowd, sending people running,” and, “Many people clutching their eyes, nose running, one man bent over vomiting.

In one of his final messages of the night, he noted: “I was struck by the kindness almost all protestors showed each other tonight, apologizing when they bumped into you, offering you water to rinse tear gas from your eyes.

Floyd was pronounced dead at a local hospital. Protests against police brutality and in support of the Black Lives Matter movement have been held across the United States since the end of May.</p><p>Rosas had arrived at the Minnesota Police Department’s Third Precinct and begun filming in the early afternoon for Townhall, which describes itself as a conservative and commentary news site. He shared videos of <a href=""https://twitter.com/Julio_Rosas11/status/1266083742000480257"">protesters</a> outside the police station and people walking through the ransacked aisles of a nearby <a href=""https://twitter.com/Julio_Rosas11/status/1266077760780414977"">Target</a>.</p><p>As evening drew close, hundreds had gathered near the police station in preparation for a third night of protests, according to <a href=""https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/05/28/george-floyd-protests-minneapolis-new-york-chicago-denver/5279809002/"">news reports</a>. The police had maintained a minimal presence throughout the afternoon, Rosas said, until a convoy of police vehicles drove in next to the Target parking lot.</p><p>A <a href=""https://twitter.com/Julio_Rosas11/status/1266143135043923973"">video</a> filmed by Rosas shows officers escorting one person apparently under arrest and patting down another. More police officers arrive in an unmarked white van. The officers are seen throwing flash bang grenades and shooting less-lethal ammunition to disperse the crowd. The video shows a water bottle thrown at the officers, who had formed a line in the middle of the street.</p><p>Rosas said he followed the police after they began to retreat from the scene. He realized he needed to find a safer place to film after he was almost hit by a tear gas canister that had been thrown back at police, he said.</p><p>Rosas laid down on a berm on the side of the road to lower his profile for safety. “I was trying to make myself as small as possible to try and get out of the way while still trying to do my job,” he said.</p><p>Rosas stopped filming during a lull in the action, he told the Tracker. Then an officer pointed his pepper ball gun from inside a Minneapolis Police vehicle directly at Rosas.</p><p>“I started shaking my head and said, ‘No, no, no, don’t do it, don’t do it,’” Rosas told the Tracker. “And then he shot me in the upper left thigh.”</p><p>Rosas said he was wearing a press badge “clearly in front” around his neck and had his phone in his hand when he was shot. He said he wasn’t sure if he was targeted specifically as a journalist. There were some protesters nearby, but he remained apart from them on the berm to avoid getting hit by thrown objects. He did nothing to indicate a threat to the police officer, he said.</p><p>Rosas said he believed he was hit by a pepper ball, a projectile similar to a paintball filled with an irritant instead of paint. The projectile left a white powder on his clothing that burned and caused him to cough.</p><p>Minnesota Police Department spokesperson John Elder told the Tracker he was unable to comment about this and other incidents involving the press. However, he said that the police department had not used pepper balls in years, instead using “40 mm less lethal foam marking rounds.” He also said, “Every use of force by the MPD is under investigation internally.”</p><p>It is not clear if other law enforcement agencies were present on the scene.

More than a <a href=""https://dps.mn.gov/divisions/ooc/news-releases/Pages/multi-agency-command-center-report-on-civil-unrest.aspx"">dozen</a> different agencies joined the law enforcement effort in Minnesota, often wearing similar-looking uniforms obscured in the chaos of tear gas-soaked streets.</p><p>Rosas continued to report despite being hit. Later that night, Mayor Jacob Frey ordered the police to evacuate the Third Precinct, which protesters then set on <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/05/28/minneapolis-protests-george-floyd-death/"">fire</a>.</p><p>The following day, Rosas was <a href=""https://pressfreedomtracker.us/all-incidents/journalist-hit-projectile-two-days-row-minneapolis/"">also hit by a projectile</a> as he filmed Minnesota State Patrol troopers and National Guardsmen confront protesters, he told the Tracker.

Protests against police brutality and in support of the Black Lives Matter movement are continuing to take place across the country.</p><p>Tsong-Tataarii was covering protests in St. Paul, Minnesota, on May 28 when he was sent to the Third Precinct in Minneapolis. In the days prior, the Third Precinct and the surrounding area had been the site of major protests and <a href=""https://pressfreedomtracker.us/all-incidents/freelance-photojournalist-permanently-blinded-others-assaulted-during-minneapolis-protests/"">multiple incidents of violence</a> perpetrated against the press by police and members of the public.</p><p>When Tsong-Tataarii arrived, he said he covered the main scene of protests before he spotted a group of people plotting to loot and burn the Arby’s restaurant across the street from the Third Precinct police station. He described this group as “violent anarchists” in a phone interview with CPJ.</p><p>“One of the efforts I tried to make was to cover the diversity of violence,” Tsong-Taatarii said. “There’s a stereotypical perception of, ‘why are these people ‘burning down their own community?’ I saw that the group was diverse; majority white, but a couple of black gentlemen, a couple of people of mixed backgrounds. I photographed them outside the Arby’s and followed them into the Arby’s hoping to mix in there and document it.”</p><p>He later uploaded <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=10157285535727828&amp;set=pcb.10157285557862828"">his images</a> to Facebook.</p><p>Tsong-Taatarii was taking photos of a man tagging a wall with “BLM,” short for Black Lives Matter, when the man turned and asked Tsong-Taatarii, “Why are you photographing a crime?”</p><p>Tsong-Taatarii said he started negotiating with the man and offered to give him one of his two cameras — the camera he did not use to photograph him. Instead, the man wanted his small Leica, the camera Tsong-Taatarii used to take his photo. While they were talking, Tsong-Taatarii slipped the Leica lens and card into his pocket, preserving his photos.</p><p>Tsong-Taatarii said that he was wearing his press badge but refrained from identifying himself as press.</p><p>“I just said, ‘I love photography and I love documenting history and this is history,’ which is all true,” he said. “I knew that if I said I was a member of the press, that would be the end of the negotiating. I felt like I had the right not to tell him.”</p><p>“At some point the negotiating stopped and one of the fellas said, ‘It’s not worth losing your life over your gear,’” Tsong-Taatarii continued. “I understood what they meant, because they were going to burn this place down and if they knocked me unconscious, I’d be laying down there. People might never find me.”</p><p>Tsong-Taatarii gave the man his Leica, which the man threw into a fire next to a street barricade. Shortly after, Tsong-Taatarii ran into the fire and retrieved his camera. While the camera was damaged, the leather case it was stored in took most of the heat, he said.</p><p>The U.S. Press Freedom Tracker is documenting several hundred incidents of journalists assaulted, arrested, struck by crowd-control ammunition or tear gas, or had their equipment damaged while covering protests across the country.
